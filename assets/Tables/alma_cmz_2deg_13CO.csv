Xue, Ci; Remijan, Anthony J.; Burkhardt, Andrew M.; Herbst, Eric","Aminoacetonitrile (NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) was detected in the interstellar medium (ISM) one decade ago in the course of a spectral survey of the hot molecular core Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) with the IRAM 30 m telescope. With the advent of sensitive telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the degree of chemical complexity in the ISM can be further explored. In the family of aminoacetonitrile, the next stage in complexity with one additional CH<SUB>2</SUB> group is aminopropionitrile. This molecule has two structural isomers, a chain-like (3-aminopropionitrile, NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) and a branched, chiral one (2-aminopropionitrile, CH<SUB>3</SUB>CH(NH<SUB>2</SUB>) CN). The latter was studied in the laboratory a few years ago and was not detected in the IRAM 30 m survey. We present the search for both isomers in the EMoCA (Exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA) survey, a sensitive spectral survey of Sgr B2(N) performed with ALMA. The rotational spectrum of 3-aminopropionitrile has been recorded in laboratory with a submillimeter spectrometer using solid-state sources. Helped by ab initio calculations performed for the different possible conformations, we present here the analysis based on a Watson Hamiltonian for an asymmetric one-top rotor in A-reduction performed in the frequency range 150-500 GHz for two conformers. More than 6200 lines of the ground-state and lowest excited vibrational states, corresponding to more than 8200 transitions, were assigned in the experimental spectrum. Partition functions, including the vibrational contribution of these states, and predictions in the JPL-CDMS catalog format were determined in order to search for both conformers of 3-aminopropionitrile in Sgr B2(N). Neither 3-aminopropionitrile, nor 2-aminopropionitrile are detected. The derived upper limits imply that they are at least 12 and 5 times less abundant than aminoacetonitrile, respectively. A comparison to ethyl cyanide and n-propyl cyanide detected in this source suggests that an improvement by a factor three in sensitivity may be sufficient to detect 3-aminopropionitrile, which should be within the range of our on-going follow-up project with ALMA. ...(20)",2014,"The search for complex pre-biotic and biotic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) will be a primary focus of ALMA science. The molecular inventory of meteorites found on Earth includes more than 80 distinct amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), and their composition suggests an interstellar origin. The key search site for new complex organics in the ISM is the hot dense core Sgr B2(N), due partly to its high column density. However, the firm identification of new molecules requires a robust spectral model to unweave the emission lines of weakly-emitting, more complex, species from known molecules. We have already constructed a unique model of this kind, using our previous single-dish line survey, which has already allowed our team to uncover several new species. We propose to use ALMA Early Science to perform a deep, unbiased line survey of Sgr B2(N) in band 3 (8 hours observing time). The proposed survey will improve the detection threshold for complex organic molecules by nearly a factor of 20 compared to our previous survey of this source. Such a sensitivity improvement should lead to the firm detection of a few, perhaps a dozen, new complex organics, while the adaptation of our existing spectral model will allow a rapid turn-around from detection to publication. The use of our team's cutting edge chemical models will allow the broader implications of new discoveries to be understood, and place strong constraints on chemical formation pathways. The discovery of biologically-relevant molecules in the ISM will be of high scientific impact, and is of broad appeal to the public and the media. The combination of ALMA's unique spectral sensitivity with our established methodologies will provide an efficient showcase of ALMA's capabilities in this field.",SgrB2_T4_B3_extended,"Garrod, Robin; Müller, Holger; Menten, Karl;",1.5389044251081678,0.031589908348318395,1.7028902769088745,,uid://A002/X327408/X14,uid://A002/X44ddb2/X64a,Expanding the frontiers of chemical complexity with ALMA,S,TARGET,T,14.646417453482266,1875000000.0,A001:DV01 A003:DA41 A004:DV04 A008:DV19 A011:DV12 A015:DV21 A020:DV20 A021:DV08 A025:DV14 A045:DA50 A045:DV11 A046:DV09 A050:DA42 A053:DV18 A067:DA46 A068:DA44 A069:DV16 A070:DA45 A071:DV10 A072:DV13 A074:DV15 A075:DA43 A076:PM03 A077:DV02 A080:DV21 A082:DV05 A137:DV03 A138:DV17 T702:PM02 T704:PM01,F,2014-09-12T00:00:00.000,1.4502098109278707,"[95.02..96.90GHz,488.28kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,62.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [96.85..98.73GHz,488.28kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,61.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [107.02..108.90GHz,488.28kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,61.5uJy/beam@native, XX] U [108.84..110.72GHz,488.28kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,68uJy/beam@native, XX]",109.7833714377833,1322.1138033812172,"Belloche, Arnaud",ALMA Observations of the Spatial Distribution of Three C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> Isomers toward Sgr B2(N) Complex organic molecules in diffuse clouds along the line of sight to Sagittarius B2 Detection of a branched alkyl molecule in the inte,"Ando, Ryo Belloche, A.

In particular, cloud-cloud collision initiated by the bar-driven inflow of molecular clouds or by feedback from past active star formation may be efficient formation process of stellar clusters cluster. Recently we detected a peculiar molecular clump not associated with major star forming GMC complexes. The clump CO-0.30-0.7 has a extremely large velocity width of 120 km/s, indicating that the entire clump is disturbed by shock possibly caused by interaction with an adjacent large expanding shell. Interestingly, the clump also has a compact core of 300-500 solar masses with narrow line width (20 km/s), which is virialized and hence capable of forming stars. At present no sign of star formation is detected toward the clump, and we speculate this is a region where cloud-cloud collision has just started, which may possibly lead cluster formation, or destruction of cloud cores.

We detected firstly the continuum emission at $340\:$ GHz of IRS 7 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The total flux density of IRS 7 is $S_{\, \nu} =448\pm 45\, \mu$ Jy. The flux density indicates that IRS 7 has a photosphere radius of $R=1170\pm 60\, R_{\odot }$ , which is roughly consistent with the previous Very Large Telescope Interferometer measurement. We also detected a shell-like feature with a northern extension in the H30α recombination line using ALMA. The electron temperature and electron density of the shell-like structure are estimated to be $\bar{T}^\ast _\mathrm{e}=4650\pm 500\:$ K and $\bar{n}_\mathrm{e}=(6.1\pm 0.6)\times 10^4\:$ cm $^{-3}$ , respectively. The mass loss rate is estimated to be $\dot{m}\,\, \sim 1\times 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot }\:$ yr $^{-1}$ , which is consistent with a typical mass loss rate of a pulsating red supergiant star with $M = 20$ - $25\, M_{\odot }$ . The kinematics of the ionized gas would support the hypothesis that the shell-like structure made by the mass loss of IRS 7 is supersonically traveling in the ambient matter towards the south. The brightened southern half of the structure and the northern extension would be a bow shock and a cometary-like tail structure, respectively. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is the variable radio, near-infrared (NIR), and X-ray source associated with accretion onto the Galactic center black hole. We have analyzed a comprehensive submillimeter (including new observations simultaneous with NIR monitoring), NIR, and 2-8 keV data set. Submillimeter variations tend to lag those in the NIR by ~30 minutes. An approximate Bayesian computation fit to the X-ray first-order structure function shows significantly less power at short timescales in the X-rays than in the NIR. Less X-ray variability at short timescales, combined with the observed NIR-X-ray correlations, means the variability can be described as the result of two strictly correlated stochastic processes, the X-ray process being the low-pass-filtered version of the NIR process.

We detected firstly the continuum emission at $340\:$ GHz of IRS 7 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The total flux density of IRS 7 is $S_{\, \nu} =448\pm 45\, \mu$ Jy. The flux density indicates that IRS 7 has a photosphere radius of $R=1170\pm 60\, R_{\odot }$ , which is roughly consistent with the previous Very Large Telescope Interferometer measurement. We also detected a shell-like feature with a northern extension in the H30α recombination line using ALMA. The electron temperature and electron density of the shell-like structure are estimated to be $\bar{T}^\ast _\mathrm{e}=4650\pm 500\:$ K and $\bar{n}_\mathrm{e}=(6.1\pm 0.6)\times 10^4\:$ cm $^{-3}$ , respectively. The mass loss rate is estimated to be $\dot{m}\,\, \sim 1\times 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot }\:$ yr $^{-1}$ , which is consistent with a typical mass loss rate of a pulsating red supergiant star with $M = 20$ - $25\, M_{\odot }$ . The kinematics of the ionized gas would support the hypothesis that the shell-like structure made by the mass loss of IRS 7 is supersonically traveling in the ambient matter towards the south. The brightened southern half of the structure and the northern extension would be a bow shock and a cometary-like tail structure, respectively. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is the variable radio, near-infrared (NIR), and X-ray source associated with accretion onto the Galactic center black hole. We have analyzed a comprehensive submillimeter (including new observations simultaneous with NIR monitoring), NIR, and 2-8 keV data set. Submillimeter variations tend to lag those in the NIR by ~30 minutes. An approximate Bayesian computation fit to the X-ray first-order structure function shows significantly less power at short timescales in the X-rays than in the NIR. Less X-ray variability at short timescales, combined with the observed NIR-X-ray correlations, means the variability can be described as the result of two strictly correlated stochastic processes, the X-ray process being the low-pass-filtered version of the NIR process. The NIR-X-ray linkage suggests a simple radiative model: a compact, self-absorbed synchrotron sphere with high-frequency cutoff close to NIR frequencies plus a synchrotron self-Compton scattering component at higher frequencies.

Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

In spite of their similar mass and luminosity, they are very different, both morphologically (M is very fragmented, N almost monolithic) and in their chemical appearence - while M is line poor, except for rich spectra of sulphur-bearing molecules, N is very line rich, and has yielded many new complex organic molecules. In this proposal, we want to do a full line survey of Band 6 toward both sources, to determine the full physical and chemical structure using 3-d radiative transfer modeling, to identify all lines and possibly find new species, and to characterize the chemical diversity spatially. This will be aided by the availability of full HIFI line surveys of both sources, which will give important constraints.",sgrb2_n_a_06_TE,"Schmiedeke, Anika; Bergin, Edwin; Sanchez-Monge, Alvaro; Müller, Holger; Qin, Sheng-Li; Lis, Dariusz; Comito, Claudia;",1.9009568916849906,0.0263252507233208,0.916003942489624,uid://A001/X12b/X10,uid://A001/X12b/X11,uid://A002/Xa08aa0/X1a39,Physical and chemical structure of massive proto-clusters,S,PHASE WVR,F,5.587732325449127,1875000000.0,A007:DV22 A010:DV02 A011:DV04 A015:DV18 A017:DA57 A021:DA59 A029:DA49 A031:DV08 A033:DV19 A034:DV20 A035:DA52 A036:DA60 A038:DV07 A042:DV17 A046:DA62 A058:DA46 A062:DV05 A066:DA64 A067:DV21 A068:DA44 A069:DA53 A070:DA47 A072:DV01 A073:DA63 A074:DV10 A075:DA61 A077:DV16 A078:DV15 A079:DA43 A080:DV24 A081:DV09 A083:DV25 A084:DV11 A085:DA51 A087:DV23 A137:DA41 A138:DV14,F,2016-08-04T10:34:00.000,0.5439924913681397,"[211.04..212.92GHz,564.45kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,118.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [212.92..214.79GHz,564.45kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,118.5uJy/beam@native, XX] U [214.79..216.67GHz,564.45kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,118.6uJy/beam@native, XX] U [216.67..218.54GHz,564.45kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,118.7uJy/beam@native, XX] U [218.54..220.42GHz,564.45kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,118.8uJy/beam@native, XX] U [220.42..222.29GHz,564.45kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,118.9uJy/beam@native, XX] U [222.29..224.17GHz,564.45kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,119uJy/beam@native, XX] U [224.17..226.04GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,116.7uJy/beam@native, XX] U [226.04..227.92GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,116.8uJy/beam@native, XX] U [227.04..228.92GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,116.9uJy/beam@native, XX] U [227.92..229.79GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,116.9uJy/beam@native, XX] U [228.92..230.79GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,117uJy/beam@native, XX] U [230.79..232.67GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,117.1uJy/beam@native, XX] U [232.67..234.54GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,117.2uJy/beam@native, XX] U [234.54..236.42GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,117.3uJy/beam@native, XX] U [236.42..238.29GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,117.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [238.29..240.17GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,117.5uJy/beam@native, XX] U [240.17..242.04GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,117.6uJy/beam@native, XX] U [242.04..243.92GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,117.8uJy/beam@native, XX] U [243.92..245.79GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,117.9uJy/beam@native, XX]",219.48021464689305,688.4066426140218,"Schilke, Peter",STATCONT: A statistical continuum level determination method for line-rich sources The physical and chemical structure of Sagittarius B2.

These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of ˜25 μJy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on ≥5σ detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S 1.2 mm ≥ 0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 μm and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2×. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs—representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies—in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution. We present the first determination of the abundance ratios of <SUP>13</SUP>C substitutions of cyanoacetylene (HC<SUB>3</SUB>N), [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN], in Titan's atmosphere measured using millimeter-wave spectra obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. To compare the line intensities precisely, data sets that include multiple molecular lines were extracted to suppress effects of Titan's environmental conditions and observation settings. The [HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] and [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] ratios were obtained from 12 and 1 selected data sets, respectively. As a result, nearly the uniform [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] abundance ratios of 1.17 ( ±0.20) : 1.09 ( ±0.25) : 1 (1σ) were derived, whereas previously reported ratios for the interstellar medium (ISM) have shown large anomalies that may be caused by <SUP>13</SUP>C concentrations in precursors. The result obtained here suggests that <SUP>13</SUP>C concentration processes suggested in the ISM studies do not work effectively on precursors of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N and HC<SUB>3</SUB>N themselves owing to Titan's high atmospheric temperature and/or depletion of both <SUP>13</SUP>C and <SUP>13</SUP>C+.",2016,"We wish to study the temperature structure and the reservoir of dense gas in the Galactic Center molecular cloud G0.253+0.016.

SMA and CARMA data (submitted to ApJ) reveal that very few cores of very dense gas exist in the cloud. The requested ALMA data form part of a long-term systematic study of the Central Molecular Zone. The main aim of the current proposal is to probe the cloud's temperature structure. Line ratios indicate gas temperatures ~80K, but dust emission suggests values <30K. This difference is surprising, since the coupling of dust and gas temperatures should be efficient at the high observed densities. The high gas temperature may suppress fragmentation and therefore star formation. Given cooling times of a few 10^4 yr, the dust-gas temperature difference may hint at heating in a cloud-cloud collision. A secondary goal is to detect dense cores in dust emission.

The presence and efficiency of the collision-induced star formation (SF) has been an issue of controversy, but we recently discovered a clear signature of collision in the cloud CO-0.30-0.07 in the CMZ; our ALMA/ACA data detected a pair of clumps contacting at a well-defined interface and a linear C18O filament just behind and parallel to the interface. Furthermore, our observations are so far consistent with the primary predictions of the collision-induced SF theory: formation of multiple filamentary structures and core-like features. We propose to conduct a higher-resolution imaging toward the cloud, in order to detect self-gravitating objects capable of forming stars and investigate the core-mass function, and thereby find the first unambiguous evidence for collision-induced SF.",CO-0.30-_a_07_7M,"Oka, Tomoharu; Nagai, Makoto; Kamegai, Kazuhisa;",34.589272351774675,1.4512492759961995,0.9100000262260437,uid://A001/X2fe/Xbb0,uid://A001/X2fe/Xbb3,uid://A002/Xb25e1a/X141fa,Collision-induced Star Formation in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone,S,TARGET,T,23.574829813384625,500000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2020-10-11T00:00:00.000,2.9070346162315412,"[314.98..316.96GHz,31250.00kHz,28.6mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [314.99..315.48GHz,484.62kHz,26.4mJy/beam@10km/s,3.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [328.47..330.46GHz,31250.00kHz,40.5mJy/beam@10km/s,3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [329.05..329.55GHz,564.45kHz,41.3mJy/beam@10km/s,6.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [330.31..330.81GHz,564.45kHz,34.6mJy/beam@10km/s,5.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",330.5554809267858,460.46602777113714,"Tanaka, Kunihiko",,,T,,"High-mass star formation, Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,13CO (3-2)

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars.

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds.

R.","We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array observations of the candidate jet-ISM interaction zones near the black hole X-ray binaries GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942. Using these data, we map the molecular line emission in the regions, detecting emission from the HCN [J = 1-0], HCO<SUP>+</SUP> [J = 1-0], SiO [J = 2-1], CS [J = 2-1], <SUP>13</SUP>CO [J = 1-0], C<SUP>18</SUP>O [J = 1-0], HNCO [J = 4<SUB>0,4</SUB>-3<SUB>0,3</SUB>], HNCO [J = 5<SUB>0,5</SUB>-4<SUB>0,4</SUB>], and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH [J = 2<SUB>1,1</SUB>-1<SUB>1,0</SUB>] molecular transitions. Through examining the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of this emission, we identify molecular structures that may trace jet-driven cavities in the gas surrounding these systems. Our results from the GRS 1758-258 region in particular, are consistent with recent work, which postulated the presence of a jet-blown cocoon structure in deep radio continuum maps of the region. Using these newly discovered molecular structures as calorimeters, we estimate the time averaged jet power from these systems, finding $(1.1{\!-\!}5.7)\times 10^{36}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.12-0.31 Myr for GRS 1758-258 and $(0.7{\!-\!}3.5)\times 10^{37}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.10-0.26 Myr for 1E 1740.7-2942. Additionally, the spectral line characteristics of the detected emission place these molecular structures in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy, thereby constraining the distances to the black hole X-ray binaries to be 8.0 ± 1.0 kpc. Overall, our analysis solidifies the diagnostic capacity of molecular lines, and highlights how astro-chemistry can both identify jet-ISM interaction zones and probe jet feedback from Galactic X-ray binaries.",2019,"Relativistic jets launched from accreting black holes carry large amounts of energy and matter into their surrounding environment. Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), the stellar-mass analogues of active galactic nuclei (AGN), are ideal targets for studying the interactions between the jet and the ambient ISM in detail, due to their close proximity and the rapid timescale evolution of BHXB jets. Identifying and probing the ISM properties in interaction zones provides insight into highly sought-after jet properties, such as the total jet power, composition, duty cycles, and the efficiency of jet feedback. We propose targeting the candidate interaction sites around the BHXBs, GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942, with Band 3 ALMA ACA observations. We will map the CO, SiO, CS, HCO+, HCN, and HNCO line emission over 4.5 square arcmin for each target (our targets are within 5 deg, and can thus be observed in a single execution). As these lines provide for excellent diagnostics of shock energetics and ISM excitation, we can definitively test whether these candidate zones are powered by a BHXB jet, and, if the association is confirmed, measure the injected jet power through calorimetry.",GRS_1758_a_03_7M,"Miller-Jones, James; Rosolowsky, Erik; Sivakoff, Gregory;",67.0263273675899,2.4130938699580557,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X1284/X195e,uid://A001/X1284/X195f,uid://A002/Xc8592e/Xfc7c,Mapping Jet-ISM Interactions in X-ray Binaries,S,TARGET,T,63.49749460141775,125000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2019-09-19T00:00:00.000,9.804731795148784,"[107.01..108.99GHz,31250.00kHz,61.2mJy/beam@10km/s,2.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [109.72..109.84GHz,282.23kHz,65.3mJy/beam@10km/s,11.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [109.84..109.97GHz,282.23kHz,66.1mJy/beam@10km/s,11.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [110.14..110.26GHz,282.23kHz,67mJy/beam@10km/s,11.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",110.20148156645686,768.1663332502987,"Tetarenko, Alexandra",ALMACAL - VI.

These gas streams are on eccentric orbits that pass by the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential well at Sgr A*. Initial investigation suggests that pericenter passage by Sgr A* may induce tidally-driven compression of clouds and subsequent star formation further downstream. This new mode of cloud collapse could give us an absolute timeline for star formation, with t= 0 occurring at pericenter passage on the streams, a fourth dimension for studies of star formation. We propose to obtain maps of the most structured cloud approaching pericenter. We outline three testable predictions of the tidally-driven cloud collapse scenario, which precludes current active star formation in the cloud. The countervailing scenarios predict none of these signatures, and instead predict star formation activity. We will perform the first detailed observational test of cloud collapse by tidal compression where the influence of the tidal field is the strongest.",Stone_Cl_a_06_TP,"Longmore, Steven; Zhang, Qizhou; Walker, Daniel; Kauffmann, Jens; Klessen, Ralf; Mills, Elisabeth; Keto, Eric; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Tolls, Volker; Ho, Luis; Lu, Xing; Rathborne, Jill; Glover, Simon; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Pillai, Thushara; Ginsburg, Adam;",9.63021018655804,0.31108625045613514,1.682520866394043,uid://A001/X892/X7,uid://A001/X892/Xe,uid://A002/Xb95160/X8647,Testing a New Mode for Cloud Collapse in Galaxy Centers,S,TARGET,T,412.4577317759457,2000000000.0,T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04 T704:PM01,F,2018-04-11T00:31:32.000,23.269147754184964,"[217.01..217.13GHz,244.14kHz,9.2mJy/beam@10km/s,2.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.12..218.25GHz,244.14kHz,9.3mJy/beam@10km/s,2.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.38..218.50GHz,244.14kHz,8.9mJy/beam@10km/s,2.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.66..218.79GHz,244.14kHz,8.7mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.87..220.87GHz,1128.91kHz,9.6mJy/beam@10km/s,583.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.00..233.00GHz,1128.91kHz,8.6mJy/beam@10km/s,533.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [232.76..234.76GHz,1128.91kHz,9.2mJy/beam@10km/s,574.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",219.86986321710484,334.49036400383636,"Battersby, Cara",,,T,,"High-mass star formation, Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,13CO (2-1)

It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds. The observations requested here will constitute the most comprehensive survey of CMZ molecular clouds yet. This economic project (4 hours of main array time) will greatly help to lead CMZ research towards work on more representative cloud samples.",20kms_a_06_TM1,"Zhang, Qizhou; Goldsmith, Paul; Lu, Xing; Immer, Katharina; Menten, Karl; Lis, Dariusz; Pillai, Thushara; Ginsburg, Adam;",5.836065593682176,0.2582024978059271,0.3683849573135376,uid://A001/X88f/X119,uid://A001/X88f/X11a,uid://A002/Xbe0d4d/X20d0,"Formation, State, and Structure of all Major CMZ Clouds",S,TARGET,T,15.147467413675031,937500000.0,A002:DA49 A003:DV22 A004:DA41 A005:DA43 A007:DV04 A009:DV18 A010:DV23 A011:DV03 A013:DA53 A014:DV17 A015:DA61 A016:DV13 A017:DV24 A018:DV09 A019:DA42 A020:DV06 A021:DA44 A022:DA48 A023:DA51 A024:DA64 A025:DA52 A026:DA54 A027:DA56 A029:DA60 A030:DV16 A034:DA46 A035:DA65 A037:DV19 A039:DA58 A040:DV25 A041:DA63 A042:DV05 A043:DV08 A044:DV12 A045:DV01 A046:DA50 A047:DA62 A048:DV10 A049:DA57 A050:DV14,T,2018-05-27T01:25:56.000,1.6825462761952237,"[217.03..217.97GHz,564.45kHz,5.9mJy/beam@10km/s,516uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.08..219.02GHz,564.45kHz,5.9mJy/beam@10km/s,516.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.98..219.92GHz,564.45kHz,5.8mJy/beam@10km/s,516.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [219.88..220.82GHz,564.45kHz,5.8mJy/beam@10km/s,516.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",220.35001180906312,766.2238130759945,"Kauffmann, Jens",The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) Project for the ALMA Science Archive,"Massardi, M.",T,2021PASP..133h5001M,Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,ari_l,13CO (2-1)

Aminoacetonitrile, a molecule detected in the interstellar medium only toward the star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), is considered an important prebiotic species; in particular, it is a possible precursor of the simplest amino acid glycine. To date, observations have been limited to ground state emission lines, whereas transitions from within vibrationally excited states remained undetected. <BR /> Aims: We wanted to accurately determine the energies of the low-lying vibrational states of aminoacetonitrile, which are expected to be populated in Sgr B2(N1), the main hot core of Sgr B2(N). This step is fundamental in order to properly evaluate the vibration-rotation partition function of aminoacetonitrile as well as the line strengths of the rotational transitions of its vibrationally excited states. This is necessary to derive accurate column densities and secure the identification of these transitions in astronomical spectra. <BR /> Methods: The far-infrared ro-vibrational spectrum of aminoacetonitrile has been recorded in absorption against a synchrotron source of continuum emission. Three bands, corresponding to the lowest vibrational modes of aminoacetonitrile, were observed in the frequency region below 500 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The combined analysis of ro-vibrational and pure rotational data allowed us to prepare new spectral line catalogs for all the states under investigation. We used the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA performed with ALMA to search for vibrationally excited aminoacetonitrile toward Sgr B2(N1). The astronomical spectra were analyzed under the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation. <BR /> Results: Almost 11 000 lines have been assigned during the analysis of the laboratory spectrum of aminoacetonitrile, thanks to which the vibrational energies of the v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1, v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1, and v<SUB>17</SUB> = 1 states have been determined. The whole dataset, which includes high J and K<SUB>a</SUB> transitions, is well reproduced within the experimental accuracy. Reliable spectral predictions of pure rotational lines can now be produced up to the THz region. On the basis of these spectroscopic predictions, we report the interstellar detection of aminoacetonitrile in its v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 vibrational states toward Sgr B2(N1) in addition to emission from its vibrational ground state. The intensities of the identified v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 lines are consistent with the detected v = 0 lines under LTE at a temperature of 200 K for an aminoacetonitrile column density of 1.1 × 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: This work shows the strong interplay between laboratory spectroscopy exploiting (sub)millimeter and synchrotron-based far-infrared techniques, and observational spectral surveys to detect complex organic molecules in space and quantify their abundances. <P />The list of assigned transitions is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160</A> ...(6)",2019,"ALMA has had a transformational effect on the search for complex organic molecules (COMs) in star-forming regions, pushing the limits of observable chemical complexity. Our recent detection of a branched alkyl molecule in the interstellar medium (ISM) with ALMA has opened a new domain in the structures available to the chemistry of star-forming regions, beyond simple chains. Our astrochemical model was recently expanded to include branched isomers, and indicates that branched molecules may be dominant in star-forming regions where the chemistry is of sufficient complexity. We propose to perform a direct observational test of this hypothesis, in order to determine both the degree and the manner in which chemical complexity evolves during star formation. We propose to search for n-butyl cyanide and its three branched isomers toward Sgr B2(N), the most fruitful target for new detections of COMs in the ISM. The discovery of biologically-relevant molecules in the ISM is of high scientific impact.

We focus on several potential shock tracers that are usually abundant in protostellar outflows, including SiO, SO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, HC<SUB>3</SUB>N, and HNCO. We identify 43 protostellar outflows, including 37 highly likely ones and 6 candidates. The outflows are found toward both known high-mass star-forming cores and less massive, seemingly quiescent cores, while 791 out of the 834 cores identified based on the continuum do not have detected outflows. The outflow masses range from less than 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to a few tens of M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with typical uncertainties of a factor of 70. We do not find evidence of disagreement between relative molecular abundances in these outflows and in nearby analogs such as the well-studied L1157 and NGC 7538S outflows. The results suggest that (i) protostellar accretion disks driving outflows ubiquitously exist in the CMZ environment, (ii) the large fraction of candidate starless cores is expected if these clouds are at very early evolutionary phases, with a caveat on the potential incompleteness of the outflows, (iii) high-mass and low-mass star formation is ongoing simultaneously in these clouds, and (iv) current data do not show evidence of a difference between the shock chemistry in the outflows that determines the molecular abundances in the CMZ environment and in nearby clouds. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 continuum observations of 2000 au resolution toward four massive molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy. To study gas fragmentation, we use the dendrogram method to identify cores as traced by the dust continuum emission. The four clouds exhibit different fragmentation states at the observed resolution despite having similar masses at the cloud scale (∼1-5 pc). Assuming a constant dust temperature of 20 K, we construct core mass functions of the clouds and find a slightly top-heavy shape as compared to the canonical initial mass function, but we note several significant uncertainties that may affect this result. The characteristic spatial separation between the cores as identified by the minimum spanning tree method, ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> au, and the characteristic core mass, 1-7 ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;, are consistent with predictions of thermal Jeans fragmentation. The three clouds showing fragmentation may be forming OB associations (stellar mass ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;). None of the four clouds under investigation seem to be currently able to form massive star clusters like the Arches and the Quintuplet (≳10<SUP>4</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;), but they may form such clusters by further gas accretion onto the cores.",2020,"The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), is a star-forming environment with extreme physical properties. Despite its large reservoir of dense gas, the CMZ appears to have a much lower current star formation rate than what the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation predicts. Theories have suggested an episodic star formation cycle which is at its near-minimum now. Our VLA and SMA observations towards a sample of four CMZ clouds have detected a population of protostellar candidates, traced by gravitationally bound dense cores and H2O masers. They may suggest an increase of current star formation than in the last few million years, consistent with the episodic star formation mode in the CMZ. However the existing data cannot confirm definitely the protostellar nature of these candidates. We propose to use ALMA, with its unprecedented capability of high sensitivity and high dynamic range, to observe these protostellar candidates.

We focus on several potential shock tracers that are usually abundant in protostellar outflows, including SiO, SO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, HC<SUB>3</SUB>N, and HNCO. We identify 43 protostellar outflows, including 37 highly likely ones and 6 candidates. The outflows are found toward both known high-mass star-forming cores and less massive, seemingly quiescent cores, while 791 out of the 834 cores identified based on the continuum do not have detected outflows. The outflow masses range from less than 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to a few tens of M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with typical uncertainties of a factor of 70. We do not find evidence of disagreement between relative molecular abundances in these outflows and in nearby analogs such as the well-studied L1157 and NGC 7538S outflows. The results suggest that (i) protostellar accretion disks driving outflows ubiquitously exist in the CMZ environment, (ii) the large fraction of candidate starless cores is expected if these clouds are at very early evolutionary phases, with a caveat on the potential incompleteness of the outflows, (iii) high-mass and low-mass star formation is ongoing simultaneously in these clouds, and (iv) current data do not show evidence of a difference between the shock chemistry in the outflows that determines the molecular abundances in the CMZ environment and in nearby clouds. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 continuum observations of 2000 au resolution toward four massive molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy. To study gas fragmentation, we use the dendrogram method to identify cores as traced by the dust continuum emission. The four clouds exhibit different fragmentation states at the observed resolution despite having similar masses at the cloud scale (∼1-5 pc). Assuming a constant dust temperature of 20 K, we construct core mass functions of the clouds and find a slightly top-heavy shape as compared to the canonical initial mass function, but we note several significant uncertainties that may affect this result. The characteristic spatial separation between the cores as identified by the minimum spanning tree method, ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> au, and the characteristic core mass, 1-7 ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;, are consistent with predictions of thermal Jeans fragmentation. The three clouds showing fragmentation may be forming OB associations (stellar mass ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;).

Despite its large reservoir of dense gas, the CMZ appears to have a much lower current star formation rate than what the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation predicts. Theories have suggested an episodic star formation cycle which is at its near-minimum now. Our VLA and SMA observations towards a sample of four CMZ clouds have detected a population of protostellar candidates, traced by gravitationally bound dense cores and H2O masers. They may suggest an increase of current star formation than in the last few million years, consistent with the episodic star formation mode in the CMZ.

We focus on several potential shock tracers that are usually abundant in protostellar outflows, including SiO, SO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, HC<SUB>3</SUB>N, and HNCO. We identify 43 protostellar outflows, including 37 highly likely ones and 6 candidates. The outflows are found toward both known high-mass star-forming cores and less massive, seemingly quiescent cores, while 791 out of the 834 cores identified based on the continuum do not have detected outflows. The outflow masses range from less than 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to a few tens of M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with typical uncertainties of a factor of 70. We do not find evidence of disagreement between relative molecular abundances in these outflows and in nearby analogs such as the well-studied L1157 and NGC 7538S outflows. The results suggest that (i) protostellar accretion disks driving outflows ubiquitously exist in the CMZ environment, (ii) the large fraction of candidate starless cores is expected if these clouds are at very early evolutionary phases, with a caveat on the potential incompleteness of the outflows, (iii) high-mass and low-mass star formation is ongoing simultaneously in these clouds, and (iv) current data do not show evidence of a difference between the shock chemistry in the outflows that determines the molecular abundances in the CMZ environment and in nearby clouds. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 continuum observations of 2000 au resolution toward four massive molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy. To study gas fragmentation, we use the dendrogram method to identify cores as traced by the dust continuum emission. The four clouds exhibit different fragmentation states at the observed resolution despite having similar masses at the cloud scale (∼1-5 pc). Assuming a constant dust temperature of 20 K, we construct core mass functions of the clouds and find a slightly top-heavy shape as compared to the canonical initial mass function, but we note several significant uncertainties that may affect this result. The characteristic spatial separation between the cores as identified by the minimum spanning tree method, ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> au, and the characteristic core mass, 1-7 ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;, are consistent with predictions of thermal Jeans fragmentation. The three clouds showing fragmentation may be forming OB associations (stellar mass ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;). None of the four clouds under investigation seem to be currently able to form massive star clusters like the Arches and the Quintuplet (≳10<SUP>4</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;), but they may form such clusters by further gas accretion onto the cores.",2020,"The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), is a star-forming environment with extreme physical properties. Despite its large reservoir of dense gas, the CMZ appears to have a much lower current star formation rate than what the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation predicts. Theories have suggested an episodic star formation cycle which is at its near-minimum now. Our VLA and SMA observations towards a sample of four CMZ clouds have detected a population of protostellar candidates, traced by gravitationally bound dense cores and H2O masers. They may suggest an increase of current star formation than in the last few million years, consistent with the episodic star formation mode in the CMZ. However the existing data cannot confirm definitely the protostellar nature of these candidates. We propose to use ALMA, with its unprecedented capability of high sensitivity and high dynamic range, to observe these protostellar candidates. The project, aiming at detecting compact CH3CN emission from natal hot molecular cores, will confirm or reject the presence of embedded protostars.

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars.

We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars. These data will provide a unique test for star formation theories in such extreme regimes and allow us to place constraints on the dominant physical mechanisms governing the formation of the most massive stars.",c_sma1_a_06_TM2,"Alves, Joao; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Johnston, Katharine; Lu, Xing; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Ginsburg, Adam; Longmore, Steven; Zhang, Qizhou; Barnes, Ashley; Kauffmann, Jens; Gomez, Laura; Keto, Eric; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ho, Luis; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate; Pillai, Thushara;",0.5556495862156716,0.019526732949095047,0.9781339168548584,uid://A001/X87d/X132,uid://A001/X87d/X135,uid://A002/Xbf9c0a/X376c,Uncovering the Early Formation of Extremely Massive Stars,S,TARGET,T,6.4791596435449685,937500000.0,A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A006:DV15 A007:DV04 A009:DV18 A010:DV23 A011:DV03 A015:DA61 A020:DV06 A021:DA44 A023:DA51 A027:DA56 A029:DA60 A034:DA46 A036:DV20 A037:DV19 A046:DA50 A047:DA62 A048:DV10 A049:DA57 A051:DA63 A053:DV14 A060:DV25 A061:DV01 A062:DV05 A063:DA45 A064:DA42 A065:DA64 A067:DV12 A068:DV13 A069:DA55 A071:DA52 A072:DA53 A073:DV22 A074:DA47 A075:DV11 A076:DV17 A077:DV24 A078:DV08 A079:DA54 A080:DV07,F,2018-05-06T03:44:41.000,0.6920259848324862,"[216.96..217.19GHz,564.45kHz,559.3uJy/beam@10km/s,98.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.08..218.31GHz,564.45kHz,558.1uJy/beam@10km/s,98.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.33..218.56GHz,564.45kHz,557.9uJy/beam@10km/s,98.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.61..218.85GHz,564.45kHz,557.6uJy/beam@10km/s,98.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [220.21..221.15GHz,564.45kHz,555.6uJy/beam@10km/s,49.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.53..233.40GHz,1938.48kHz,518.5uJy/beam@10km/s,33.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [234.03..235.90GHz,1938.48kHz,516.4uJy/beam@10km/s,33.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",220.67885786034384,765.0994689396706,"Walker, Daniel",Star formation in 'the Brick': ALMA reveals an active protocluster in the Galactic centre cloud G0.253+0.016 The initial conditions for young massive cluster formation in the Galactic Centre: convergence of large-scale gas flows,"Walker, Daniel L.

It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars.

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds. The observations requested here will constitute the most comprehensive survey of CMZ molecular clouds yet. This economic project (4 hours of main array time) will greatly help to lead CMZ research towards work on more representative cloud samples.",20kms_b_06_TM1,"Zhang, Qizhou; Goldsmith, Paul; Lu, Xing; Immer, Katharina; Menten, Karl; Lis, Dariusz; Pillai, Thushara; Ginsburg, Adam;",8.498052048429166,0.3839647628498441,2.335418701171875,uid://A001/X88f/X125,uid://A001/X88f/X126,uid://A002/Xbe025c/X1270,"Formation, State, and Structure of all Major CMZ Clouds",S,TARGET,T,13.609550613365258,937500000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A003:DV22 A004:DA41 A005:DA43 A007:DV04 A008:DV07 A009:DV18 A010:DV23 A011:DV03 A013:DA53 A014:DV17 A015:DA61 A016:DV13 A017:DV24 A018:DV09 A019:DA42 A020:DV06 A021:DA44 A022:DA48 A023:DA51 A024:DA64 A025:DA52 A026:DA54 A027:DA56 A029:DA60 A030:DV16 A034:DA46 A037:DV19 A039:DA58 A040:DV25 A041:DA63 A042:DV05 A043:DV08 A044:DV12 A046:DA50 A047:DA62 A048:DV10 A049:DA57 A050:DV14 A069:DA55 A075:DV11,T,2018-03-30T22:14:17.000,1.4361566362416731,"[217.03..217.97GHz,564.45kHz,8.8mJy/beam@10km/s,772.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.08..219.02GHz,564.45kHz,8.8mJy/beam@10km/s,773.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.98..219.92GHz,564.45kHz,8.8mJy/beam@10km/s,773.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [219.88..220.82GHz,564.45kHz,8.5mJy/beam@10km/s,752.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",220.35004085571842,766.2226840765245,"Kauffmann, Jens",The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) Project for the ALMA Science Archive,"Massardi, M.",T,2021PASP..133h5001M,Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,13CO (2-1)

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars. These data will provide a unique test for star formation theories in such extreme regimes and allow us to place constraints on the dominant physical mechanisms governing the formation of the most massive stars.",d_sma1_a_06_TM1,"Alves, Joao; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Johnston, Katharine; Lu, Xing; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Ginsburg, Adam; Longmore, Steven; Zhang, Qizhou; Barnes, Ashley; Kauffmann, Jens; Gomez, Laura; Keto, Eric; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ho, Luis; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate; Pillai, Thushara;",0.40112708084317333,0.014271692487980228,0.4971645176410675,uid://A001/X87d/X138,uid://A001/X87d/X139,uid://A002/Xb95160/X9032,Uncovering the Early Formation of Extremely Massive Stars,S,TARGET,T,1.6993469718046814,937500000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A007:DV12 A009:DV18 A015:DA61 A027:DV06 A034:DA46 A064:DA42 A064:DV13 A065:DV01 A069:DA55 A070:DA48 A071:DA52 A072:DA53 A073:DV22 A074:DA47 A074:DV09 A075:DV11 A075:DV24 A076:DV17 A078:DV08 A079:DA54 A081:DA43 A081:DA53 A084:DV04 A084:DV07 A085:DA47 A086:DV01 A086:DV11 A087:DV10 A087:DV25 A088:DA57 A089:DV06 A090:DV24 A091:DA45 A091:DA63 A092:DV14 A092:DV17 A093:DV02 A093:DV20 A094:DA45 A094:DV19 A095:DV10 A095:DV25 A096:DA65 A096:DV09 A097:DA60 A097:DV03 A098:DV05 A098:DV21 A099:DA63 A099:DV06 A100:DA56 A100:DA65 A101:DA60 A101:DA62 A102:DV03 A102:DV16 A103:DA62 A103:DV16 A104:DA58 A104:DV14 A105:DA42 A105:DV02 A106:DV08 ,F,2018-09-05T16:07:13.000,0.09929584412768204,"[216.97..217.21GHz,564.45kHz,403.7uJy/beam@10km/s,71uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.09..218.32GHz,564.45kHz,402.9uJy/beam@10km/s,71uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.34..218.58GHz,564.45kHz,402.7uJy/beam@10km/s,71uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.63..218.86GHz,564.45kHz,402.5uJy/beam@10km/s,71uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [220.23..221.16GHz,564.45kHz,401.1uJy/beam@10km/s,35.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.55..233.42GHz,1938.48kHz,381.1uJy/beam@10km/s,24.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [234.05..235.92GHz,1938.48kHz,379.6uJy/beam@10km/s,24.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",220.69415586415613,765.1424513159687,"Walker, Daniel",Star formation in 'the Brick': ALMA reveals an active protocluster in the Galactic centre cloud G0.253+0.016 The initial conditions for young massive cluster formation in the Galactic Centre: convergence of large-scale gas flows,"Walker, Daniel L.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars.

Since the cloud is not associated with any visible energy sources capable of producing the observed fast turbulence, its nature remains unknown. Recently, an interesting hypothesis has been proposed, which claims that the broad emission comes from gas trailing from a clump gravitationally kicked by an intermediate-mass blackhole (IMBH) of 1e5 Msun. However, the follow-up observation with ALMA has raised several question on the fundamental assumptions made in the IMBH hypothesis, as it failed to detect clear signature of the hypothesized trailing gas. To address this problem, we propose to perform new multi-line imaging observations of the cloud in Bands-6 and -7. The setup of our observations allows to investigate the narrow-line quiescent gas components that have been previously missed. On the basis of the rich information on the cloud's kinematics, physical conditions, and chemistry provided by this observation, we will attempt to re-examine the IMBH hypothesis and to explore an alternative hypothesis in terms of cloud-cloud collision.",CO-0.40-_a_06_TM1,"Nagai, Makoto; Kamegai, Kazuhisa;",2.8932381184110354,0.1174600630734984,1.063847541809082,uid://A001/X1290/X2a,uid://A001/X1290/X2b,uid://A002/Xcd64ec/X486a,Dense Gas associated with the Claimed Intermediate-mass Blackhole Object CO-0.40,S,TARGET,T,11.609576838684603,937500000.0,A002:DA46 A003:DV12 A004:DA52 A006:DA61 A007:DV05 A008:DA42 A009:DV18 A011:DV21 A013:DV24 A015:DA64 A016:DA44 A017:DA56 A019:DA58 A022:DV23 A023:DA41 A024:DA49 A025:DV02 A026:DA57 A027:DV06 A028:DA63 A030:DA59 A031:DA48 A033:DA53 A034:DA55 A035:DA47 A036:DA45 A038:DV22 A039:DV14 A040:DA51 A041:DV19 A042:DV08 A043:DA60 A044:DV11 A045:DV01 A046:DA54 A047:DV15 A048:DA62 A049:DV03 A058:DA43 A060:DV17 A062:DV10 A066:DV04 A068:DA65 A069:DV16 A072:DV20 A074:DV09,T,2019-06-13T19:33:32.000,1.1834080841795722,"[216.11..217.98GHz,1128.91kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,180.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.15..218.38GHz,564.45kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,511.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.40..218.64GHz,564.45kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,512uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.69..218.92GHz,564.45kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,512.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [219.14..220.07GHz,564.45kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,256.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [219.97..220.91GHz,564.45kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,256.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",220.44279513618176,765.9368071724642,"Tanaka, Kunihiko",,,T,,Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,13CO (2-1)

It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions.

Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation. Because both events were accompanied by maser flares, single-dish maser monitoring programs were reinvigorated. As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region, G358.931-0.030. Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst. Because this outburst has been caught in a much earlier stage, we have the best opportunity yet to explore and understand the underlying mechanism. Much like NGC6334I-MM1, the lack of a near-IR counterpart indicates a very deeply-embedded protostar. ALMA DDT observations are now critical to provide a clear picture of star formation in this protocluster by pinpointing the outbursting protostar with respect to the masers before they fade, and placing their kinematics into context of the dust and thermal gas structures that trace protostellar accretion and outflow.",G358.93_a_07_TM1,"Hirano, Naomi; Cyganowski, Claudia; MacLeod, Gordon; Sugiyama, Koichiro; Hunter, Todd; Chibueze, James; Menten, Karl; Stecklum, Bringfried; Sobolev, Andrey; Burns, Ross;",0.6284925366958845,0.043795465736191246,0.5909620523452759,uid://A001/X13b3/Xd7,uid://A001/X13b3/Xd8,uid://A002/Xdab261/Xc6d6,"Exploring the dust, thermal gas, and new methanol masers in the third massive protostellar outburst: G358.931-0.030",T,TARGET,T,4.398584557777386,937500000.0,A001:DA44 A002:DA51 A007:DV05 A010:DV13 A011:DV21 A015:DA64 A016:DV11 A017:DV14 A022:DV23 A023:DA42 A024:DA49 A025:DA46 A026:DV19 A027:DV06 A033:DA53 A035:DA43 A036:DA45 A040:DA55 A042:DV08 A043:DA60 A044:DV03 A045:DV01 A047:DV15 A048:DV02 A049:DA47 A058:DA41 A060:DV17 A062:DV10 A066:DV04 A068:DA65 A069:DV16 A070:DA62 A072:DV20 A073:DA59 A074:DV09 A075:DA52 A076:DA63 A082:DA54 A083:DV22 A085:DA48 A088:DV24 A089:DA56 T702:PM03 T703:PM01 T704:PM04,F,2019-11-10T22:14:56.000,0.41815929537627294,"[330.13..330.25GHz,141.11kHz,628.8uJy/beam@10km/s,192.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [330.35..331.29GHz,564.45kHz,628.5uJy/beam@10km/s,68.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [331.71..331.83GHz,141.11kHz,628uJy/beam@10km/s,193uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [342.43..343.37GHz,564.45kHz,636.9uJy/beam@10km/s,70.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [343.56..343.68GHz,141.11kHz,636.5uJy/beam@10km/s,199.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [344.27..344.39GHz,141.11kHz,636.2uJy/beam@10km/s,199.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",330.81768246970614,122.86643168390579,"Brogan, Crystal",A Multitransition Methanol Maser Study of the Accretion Burst Source G358.93-0.03-MM1 Sub-arcsecond (Sub)millimeter Imaging of the Massive Protocluster G358.93−0.03: Discovery of 14 New Methanol Maser Lines Associated with a Hot Core,"Bayandina, O.

It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds.

These gas streams are on eccentric orbits that pass by the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential well at Sgr A*. Initial investigation suggests that pericenter passage by Sgr A* may induce tidally-driven compression of clouds and subsequent star formation further downstream. This new mode of cloud collapse could give us an absolute timeline for star formation, with t= 0 occurring at pericenter passage on the streams, a fourth dimension for studies of star formation. We propose to obtain maps of the most structured cloud approaching pericenter. We outline three testable predictions of the tidally-driven cloud collapse scenario, which precludes current active star formation in the cloud. The countervailing scenarios predict none of these signatures, and instead predict star formation activity. We will perform the first detailed observational test of cloud collapse by tidal compression where the influence of the tidal field is the strongest.",Stone_Cl_a_06_7M,"Longmore, Steven; Zhang, Qizhou; Walker, Daniel; Kauffmann, Jens; Klessen, Ralf; Mills, Elisabeth; Keto, Eric; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Tolls, Volker; Ho, Luis; Lu, Xing; Rathborne, Jill; Glover, Simon; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Pillai, Thushara; Ginsburg, Adam;",28.974519319781425,0.9435240942048687,1.7999999523162842,uid://A001/X892/X7,uid://A001/X892/Xa,uid://A002/Xbf4033/X2fba,Testing a New Mode for Cloud Collapse in Galaxy Centers,S,TARGET,T,37.36835722516678,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2019-05-19T00:00:00.000,4.8211936688996,"[217.01..217.13GHz,244.14kHz,29.2mJy/beam@10km/s,7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.12..218.25GHz,244.14kHz,28.3mJy/beam@10km/s,6.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.38..218.50GHz,244.14kHz,26.9mJy/beam@10km/s,6.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.66..218.79GHz,244.14kHz,25.8mJy/beam@10km/s,6.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.87..220.87GHz,1128.91kHz,29mJy/beam@10km/s,1.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.00..233.00GHz,1128.91kHz,26.1mJy/beam@10km/s,1.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [232.76..234.76GHz,1128.91kHz,27.9mJy/beam@10km/s,1.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",219.87040028741268,334.4951536654481,"Battersby, Cara",,,T,,"High-mass star formation, Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,13CO (2-1)

Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation. Because both events were accompanied by maser flares, single-dish maser monitoring programs were reinvigorated. As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region, G358.931-0.030. Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst.

N.","We present (sub)millimeter imaging at 0.″5 resolution of the massive star-forming region G358.93−0.03 acquired in multiple epochs at 2 and 3 months following the recent flaring of its 6.7 GHz CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser emission. Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation. Because both events were accompanied by maser flares, single-dish maser monitoring programs were reinvigorated. As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region, G358.931-0.030. Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst.

M.","Using the JVLA, we explored the Galactic center (GC) with a resolution of 0.″05 at 33.0 and 44.6 GHz. We detected 64 hypercompact radio sources (HCRs) in the central parsec. The dense group of HCRs can be divided into three spectral types: 38 steep-spectrum (α ≤ -0.5) sources, 10 flat-spectrum (-0.5 &lt; α ≤ 0.2) sources, and 17 inverted-spectrum sources having α &gt; 0.2, assuming S ∝ ν <SUP> α </SUP>. The steep-spectrum HCRs are likely to represent a population of massive stellar remnants associated with nonthermal compact radio sources powered by neutron stars and stellar black holes. The surface-density distribution of the HCRs as a function of radial distance (R) from Sgr A* can be described as a steep power law Σ(R) ∝ R <SUP>-Γ</SUP>, with Γ = 1.6 ± 0.2, along with the presence of a localized order-of-magnitude enhancement in the range 0.1-0.3 pc. The steeper profile of the HCRs relative to that of the central cluster might result from the concentration of massive stellar remnants by mass segregation at the GC. The GC magnetar SGR J1745-2900 belongs to the inverted-spectrum subsample. We find two spectral components present in the averaged radio spectrum of SGR J1745-2900, separated at ν ~ 30 GHz. The centimeter component is fitted to a power law with α <SUB>cm</SUB> = -1.5 ± 0.6. The enhanced millimeter component shows a rising spectrum α <SUB>mm</SUB> = 1.1 ± 0.2. Based on the ALMA observations at 225 GHz, we find that the GC magnetar is highly variable on a day-to-day timescale, showing variations up to a factor of 6. Further JVLA and ALMA observations of the variability, spectrum, and polarization of the HCRs are critical for determining whether they are associated with stellar remnants.",2022,"Sagittarius A*, the variable radio/IR/X-ray source associated with the supermassive black hole at the center of the Galaxy, has recently (April-May 2019) displayed unusual episodes of activity in the infrared and at 230 GHz. An unprecedentedly bright intensity excursion was observed at 2.2 µm with the Keck Observatory, well outside of the range of the 13,000 previous independent integrations with Keck, VLT and Spitzer. Other Keck observations in April and May have also shown episodes of unusually high fluxes, leading us to consider whether the source has entered a new, higher state of activity, or whether its accretion rate has risen.

M.","Using the JVLA, we explored the Galactic center (GC) with a resolution of 0.″05 at 33.0 and 44.6 GHz. We detected 64 hypercompact radio sources (HCRs) in the central parsec. The dense group of HCRs can be divided into three spectral types: 38 steep-spectrum (α ≤ -0.5) sources, 10 flat-spectrum (-0.5 &lt; α ≤ 0.2) sources, and 17 inverted-spectrum sources having α &gt; 0.2, assuming S ∝ ν <SUP> α </SUP>. The steep-spectrum HCRs are likely to represent a population of massive stellar remnants associated with nonthermal compact radio sources powered by neutron stars and stellar black holes. The surface-density distribution of the HCRs as a function of radial distance (R) from Sgr A* can be described as a steep power law Σ(R) ∝ R <SUP>-Γ</SUP>, with Γ = 1.6 ± 0.2, along with the presence of a localized order-of-magnitude enhancement in the range 0.1-0.3 pc. The steeper profile of the HCRs relative to that of the central cluster might result from the concentration of massive stellar remnants by mass segregation at the GC. The GC magnetar SGR J1745-2900 belongs to the inverted-spectrum subsample. We find two spectral components present in the averaged radio spectrum of SGR J1745-2900, separated at ν ~ 30 GHz. The centimeter component is fitted to a power law with α <SUB>cm</SUB> = -1.5 ± 0.6. The enhanced millimeter component shows a rising spectrum α <SUB>mm</SUB> = 1.1 ± 0.2. Based on the ALMA observations at 225 GHz, we find that the GC magnetar is highly variable on a day-to-day timescale, showing variations up to a factor of 6. Further JVLA and ALMA observations of the variability, spectrum, and polarization of the HCRs are critical for determining whether they are associated with stellar remnants.",2022,"Sagittarius A*, the variable radio/IR/X-ray source associated with the supermassive black hole at the center of the Galaxy, has recently (April-May 2019) displayed unusual episodes of activity in the infrared and at 230 GHz. An unprecedentedly bright intensity excursion was observed at 2.2 µm with the Keck Observatory, well outside of the range of the 13,000 previous independent integrations with Keck, VLT and Spitzer. Other Keck observations in April and May have also shown episodes of unusually high fluxes, leading us to consider whether the source has entered a new, higher state of activity, or whether its accretion rate has risen. In either case, it is important to learn whether it is evolving and how long it will last, presuming that it is lasting longer than the April-May time frame.

These new observations reveal the presence of a ring-like molecular structure surrounding the star. Morphology and kinematics of the gas are consistent with a slowly expanding torus located near the equatorial plane of AG Car. Using non-LTE line modelling, we derived the physical parameters of the gas, which is warm (∼50 K) and moderately dense (∼10<SUP>3</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). The total mass of molecular gas in the ring is 2.7 ± 0.9 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. We analysed the radio continuum map, which depicts a point-like source surrounded by a shallow nebula. From the flux of the point-like source, we derived a current mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = (1.55\pm 0.21)\times 10^{-5}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Finally, to better understand the complex circumstellar environment of AG Car, we put the newly detected ring in relation to the main nebula of dust and ionized gas. We discuss possible formation scenarios for the ring, namely, the accumulation of interstellar material due to the action of the stellar wind, the remnant of a close binary interaction or merger, and an equatorially enhanced mass-loss episode. If molecular gas formed in situ as a result of a mass eruption, it would account for at least a $30{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the total mass ejected by AG Car. This detection adds a new piece to the puzzle of the complex mass-loss history of AG Car, providing new clues about the interplay between LBV stars and their surroundings.",2021,"Massive stars play a fundamental role in the evolution of galaxies. they are among the major contributors to the interstellar UV radiation and provide processed material and mechanical energy to the ISM via their strong winds.Evolutionary models fail to reproduce the transition between their O and WR phases, mostly because of the poor knowledge of the amount of mass lost during the transition. recent work on three LBVs has shown that a so far neglected component of molecular gas is present around these stars. On the basis, of the three previous detections and our APEX data, we propose to observe 9 Galactic LBVs with the ACA in the 12CO and 13CO J=2-1 lines.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","Binary interactions dominate the evolution of massive stars, but their role is less clear for low- and intermediate-mass stars. The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains.

The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","Binary interactions dominate the evolution of massive stars, but their role is less clear for low- and intermediate-mass stars. The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF.

These gas streams are on eccentric orbits that pass by the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential well at Sgr A*. Initial investigation suggests that pericenter passage by Sgr A* may induce tidally-driven compression of clouds and subsequent star formation further downstream. This new mode of cloud collapse could give us an absolute timeline for star formation, with t= 0 occurring at pericenter passage on the streams, a fourth dimension for studies of star formation. We propose to obtain maps of the most structured cloud approaching pericenter. We outline three testable predictions of the tidally-driven cloud collapse scenario, which precludes current active star formation in the cloud.

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds. The observations requested here will constitute the most comprehensive survey of CMZ molecular clouds yet. This economic project (4 hours of main array time) will greatly help to lead CMZ research towards work on more representative cloud samples.",20kms_a_06_7M,"Zhang, Qizhou; Goldsmith, Paul; Lu, Xing; Immer, Katharina; Menten, Karl; Lis, Dariusz; Pillai, Thushara; Ginsburg, Adam;",51.018028253042964,2.170251697677493,1.7999999523162842,uid://A001/X88f/X119,uid://A001/X88f/X11c,uid://A002/Xb9dfa4/X813b,"Formation, State, and Structure of all Major CMZ Clouds",S,TARGET,T,39.66478854601974,1000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2019-05-14T00:00:00.000,5.453888137215827,"[217.00..218.00GHz,564.45kHz,52.7mJy/beam@10km/s,4.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.05..219.05GHz,564.45kHz,52.2mJy/beam@10km/s,4.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.95..219.95GHz,564.45kHz,47.7mJy/beam@10km/s,4.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [219.85..220.85GHz,564.45kHz,51mJy/beam@10km/s,4.4mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",220.3507722890393,766.233985489839,"Kauffmann, Jens",The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) Project for the ALMA Science Archive,"Massardi, M.",T,2021PASP..133h5001M,Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,13CO (2-1)

M.","Using the JVLA, we explored the Galactic center (GC) with a resolution of 0.″05 at 33.0 and 44.6 GHz. We detected 64 hypercompact radio sources (HCRs) in the central parsec. The dense group of HCRs can be divided into three spectral types: 38 steep-spectrum (α ≤ -0.5) sources, 10 flat-spectrum (-0.5 &lt; α ≤ 0.2) sources, and 17 inverted-spectrum sources having α &gt; 0.2, assuming S ∝ ν <SUP> α </SUP>. The steep-spectrum HCRs are likely to represent a population of massive stellar remnants associated with nonthermal compact radio sources powered by neutron stars and stellar black holes. The surface-density distribution of the HCRs as a function of radial distance (R) from Sgr A* can be described as a steep power law Σ(R) ∝ R <SUP>-Γ</SUP>, with Γ = 1.6 ± 0.2, along with the presence of a localized order-of-magnitude enhancement in the range 0.1-0.3 pc. The steeper profile of the HCRs relative to that of the central cluster might result from the concentration of massive stellar remnants by mass segregation at the GC. The GC magnetar SGR J1745-2900 belongs to the inverted-spectrum subsample. We find two spectral components present in the averaged radio spectrum of SGR J1745-2900, separated at ν ~ 30 GHz. The centimeter component is fitted to a power law with α <SUB>cm</SUB> = -1.5 ± 0.6. The enhanced millimeter component shows a rising spectrum α <SUB>mm</SUB> = 1.1 ± 0.2. Based on the ALMA observations at 225 GHz, we find that the GC magnetar is highly variable on a day-to-day timescale, showing variations up to a factor of 6. Further JVLA and ALMA observations of the variability, spectrum, and polarization of the HCRs are critical for determining whether they are associated with stellar remnants.",2022,"Sagittarius A*, the variable radio/IR/X-ray source associated with the supermassive black hole at the center of the Galaxy, has recently (April-May 2019) displayed unusual episodes of activity in the infrared and at 230 GHz. An unprecedentedly bright intensity excursion was observed at 2.2 µm with the Keck Observatory, well outside of the range of the 13,000 previous independent integrations with Keck, VLT and Spitzer. Other Keck observations in April and May have also shown episodes of unusually high fluxes, leading us to consider whether the source has entered a new, higher state of activity, or whether its accretion rate has risen.

M.","Using the JVLA, we explored the Galactic center (GC) with a resolution of 0.″05 at 33.0 and 44.6 GHz. We detected 64 hypercompact radio sources (HCRs) in the central parsec. The dense group of HCRs can be divided into three spectral types: 38 steep-spectrum (α ≤ -0.5) sources, 10 flat-spectrum (-0.5 &lt; α ≤ 0.2) sources, and 17 inverted-spectrum sources having α &gt; 0.2, assuming S ∝ ν <SUP> α </SUP>. The steep-spectrum HCRs are likely to represent a population of massive stellar remnants associated with nonthermal compact radio sources powered by neutron stars and stellar black holes. The surface-density distribution of the HCRs as a function of radial distance (R) from Sgr A* can be described as a steep power law Σ(R) ∝ R <SUP>-Γ</SUP>, with Γ = 1.6 ± 0.2, along with the presence of a localized order-of-magnitude enhancement in the range 0.1-0.3 pc. The steeper profile of the HCRs relative to that of the central cluster might result from the concentration of massive stellar remnants by mass segregation at the GC. The GC magnetar SGR J1745-2900 belongs to the inverted-spectrum subsample. We find two spectral components present in the averaged radio spectrum of SGR J1745-2900, separated at ν ~ 30 GHz. The centimeter component is fitted to a power law with α <SUB>cm</SUB> = -1.5 ± 0.6. The enhanced millimeter component shows a rising spectrum α <SUB>mm</SUB> = 1.1 ± 0.2. Based on the ALMA observations at 225 GHz, we find that the GC magnetar is highly variable on a day-to-day timescale, showing variations up to a factor of 6. Further JVLA and ALMA observations of the variability, spectrum, and polarization of the HCRs are critical for determining whether they are associated with stellar remnants.",2022,"Sagittarius A*, the variable radio/IR/X-ray source associated with the supermassive black hole at the center of the Galaxy, has recently (April-May 2019) displayed unusual episodes of activity in the infrared and at 230 GHz. An unprecedentedly bright intensity excursion was observed at 2.2 µm with the Keck Observatory, well outside of the range of the 13,000 previous independent integrations with Keck, VLT and Spitzer. Other Keck observations in April and May have also shown episodes of unusually high fluxes, leading us to consider whether the source has entered a new, higher state of activity, or whether its accretion rate has risen.

These new observations reveal the presence of a ring-like molecular structure surrounding the star. Morphology and kinematics of the gas are consistent with a slowly expanding torus located near the equatorial plane of AG Car. Using non-LTE line modelling, we derived the physical parameters of the gas, which is warm (∼50 K) and moderately dense (∼10<SUP>3</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). The total mass of molecular gas in the ring is 2.7 ± 0.9 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. We analysed the radio continuum map, which depicts a point-like source surrounded by a shallow nebula. From the flux of the point-like source, we derived a current mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = (1.55\pm 0.21)\times 10^{-5}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Finally, to better understand the complex circumstellar environment of AG Car, we put the newly detected ring in relation to the main nebula of dust and ionized gas. We discuss possible formation scenarios for the ring, namely, the accumulation of interstellar material due to the action of the stellar wind, the remnant of a close binary interaction or merger, and an equatorially enhanced mass-loss episode. If molecular gas formed in situ as a result of a mass eruption, it would account for at least a $30{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the total mass ejected by AG Car. This detection adds a new piece to the puzzle of the complex mass-loss history of AG Car, providing new clues about the interplay between LBV stars and their surroundings.",2021,"Massive stars play a fundamental role in the evolution of galaxies. they are among the major contributors to the interstellar UV radiation and provide processed material and mechanical energy to the ISM via their strong winds.Evolutionary models fail to reproduce the transition between their O and WR phases, mostly because of the poor knowledge of the amount of mass lost during the transition. recent work on three LBVs has shown that a so far neglected component of molecular gas is present around these stars. On the basis, of the three previous detections and our APEX data, we propose to observe 9 Galactic LBVs with the ACA in the 12CO and 13CO J=2-1 lines.

Using these data, we map the molecular line emission in the regions, detecting emission from the HCN [J = 1-0], HCO<SUP>+</SUP> [J = 1-0], SiO [J = 2-1], CS [J = 2-1], <SUP>13</SUP>CO [J = 1-0], C<SUP>18</SUP>O [J = 1-0], HNCO [J = 4<SUB>0,4</SUB>-3<SUB>0,3</SUB>], HNCO [J = 5<SUB>0,5</SUB>-4<SUB>0,4</SUB>], and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH [J = 2<SUB>1,1</SUB>-1<SUB>1,0</SUB>] molecular transitions. Through examining the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of this emission, we identify molecular structures that may trace jet-driven cavities in the gas surrounding these systems. Our results from the GRS 1758-258 region in particular, are consistent with recent work, which postulated the presence of a jet-blown cocoon structure in deep radio continuum maps of the region. Using these newly discovered molecular structures as calorimeters, we estimate the time averaged jet power from these systems, finding $(1.1{\!-\!}5.7)\times 10^{36}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.12-0.31 Myr for GRS 1758-258 and $(0.7{\!-\!}3.5)\times 10^{37}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.10-0.26 Myr for 1E 1740.7-2942. Additionally, the spectral line characteristics of the detected emission place these molecular structures in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy, thereby constraining the distances to the black hole X-ray binaries to be 8.0 ± 1.0 kpc. Overall, our analysis solidifies the diagnostic capacity of molecular lines, and highlights how astro-chemistry can both identify jet-ISM interaction zones and probe jet feedback from Galactic X-ray binaries.",2020,"Relativistic jets launched from accreting black holes carry large amounts of energy and matter into their environment. Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), the stellar-mass analogues of active galactic nuclei, are ideal targets for studying the interactions between the jet and the ambient ISM in detail, due to their close proximity and the rapid timescale evolution of BHXB jets. Identifying and probing the ISM properties in interaction zones provides insight into highly sought-after jet properties, such as the jet power, composition, duty cycles, and the efficiency of jet feedback. As molecular lines are excellent diagnostics of shock energetics and ISM excitation, our team recently obtained ALMA ACA observations of the candidate interaction sites around the BHXBs GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942, identifying several intriguing compact regions of bright molecular emission. Here we propose follow-up, high resolution ALMA 12m array observations of these fields (total time of 2.3 hours). With these data we will build on our first results to test whether these zones are consistent with being powered by a BHXB jet, and estimate the energy input into the ISM from these BHXB jets.",1E1740.7_a_03_TM1,"Miller-Jones, James; Rosolowsky, Erik; Sivakoff, Gregory;",2.9208186692751457,0.06472870926741933,0.8543169498443604,uid://A001/X1469/X280,uid://A001/X1469/X281,uid://A002/Xe4f0a6/X75dd,Mapping Jet-ISM Interactions in X-ray Binaries,S,TARGET,T,27.675012270976623,117187500.0,A001:DA48 A002:DA44 A003:DV23 A004:DA56 A005:DV22 A006:DV13 A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A013:DV11 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A024:DA58 A025:DV10 A026:DV18 A027:DV17 A028:DA59 A030:DA52 A031:DA62 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A038:DA60 A039:DV16 A040:DA65 A041:DV03 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A046:DA51 A047:DV06 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A072:DA53,T,2021-03-26T14:43:57.000,2.72003623470114,"[94.99..96.97GHz,31250.00kHz,2.8mJy/beam@10km/s,112.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [96.99..98.97GHz,31250.00kHz,2.7mJy/beam@10km/s,109.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [107.03..109.01GHz,31250.00kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,125.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [109.72..109.84GHz,282.23kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,517.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [109.85..109.96GHz,282.23kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,517.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [110.14..110.26GHz,282.23kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,517.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",110.20136143475521,768.1639175100375,"Tetarenko, Alexandra",Jet-ISM interactions near the microquasars GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942,"Tetarenko, A.

These abundant molecular lines may tell us a great deal about protostellar cores, outflows, shocks, and general gas properties, but at the moment, we do not know which lines are associated with different physical processes. A reference survey showing which lines are excited and where they are excited is needed to interpret existing CMZ observations, to plan future observations, and to enable comparison between our CMZ and the centers of other galaxies. We propose a blind, complete spectral line survey covering bands 3-7 of a single pointing in the CMZ to determine which lines can be used to trace: (1) protostellar cores, (2) turbulent shocks, (3) diffuse and quiescent molecular gas, and (4) protostellar outflows in the CMZ.

As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region G358.93-0.03. Since then, the global maser community has discovered 20 new torsionally-excited methanol maser transitions from 6 to 360 GHz toward this source(!), all likely powered by an ongoing accretion outburst in a massive protostar.

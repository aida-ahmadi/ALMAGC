The 89 GHz emission is area-filling, optically thick, and sub-thermally excited. Two types of filaments are seen in absorption against the HCO+ emission. Broad-line absorption filaments (BLAs) have widths of less than a few arcseconds (0.07-0.14 pc), lengths of 30-50 arcsec (1.2-1.8 pc), and absorption profiles extending over a velocity range larger than 20 km s–1. The BLAs are nearly parallel to the nearby G0.18 non-thermal filaments and may trace HCO+ molecules gyrating about highly ordered magnetic fields located in front of G0.253+0.016 or edge-on sheets formed behind supersonic shocks propagating orthogonal to our line of sight in the foreground. Narrow-line absorption filaments (NLAs) have line widths less than 20 km s–1. Some NLAs are also seen in absorption in other species with high optical depth, such as HCN, and occasionally in emission where the background is faint. The NLAs, which also trace low-density, sub-thermally excited HCO+ molecules, are mostly seen on the blueshifted side of the emission from G0.253+0.016. If associated with the surface of G0.253+0.016, the kinematics of the NLAs indicate that the cloud surface is expanding. The decompression of entrained, milli-Gauss magnetic fields may be responsible for the re-expansion of the surface layers of G0.253+0.016 as it recedes from the Galactic center following a close encounter with Sgr A. Despite the simplicity of theoretical models of supersonically turbulent, isothermal media, their predictions successfully match the observed gas structure and star formation activity within low-pressure (P/k &#60; 105 K cm–3) molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood. However, it is unknown whether or not these theories extend to clouds in high-pressure (P/k &#62; 107 K cm–3) environments, like those in the Galaxy's inner 200 pc central molecular zone (CMZ) and in the early universe. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 3 mm dust continuum emission within a cloud, G0.253+0.016, which is immersed in the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. While the log-normal shape and dispersion of its column density probability distribution function (PDF) are strikingly similar to those of solar neighborhood clouds, there is one important quantitative difference: its mean column density is one to two orders of magnitude higher. Both the similarity and difference in the PDF compared to those derived from solar neighborhood clouds match predictions of turbulent cloud models given the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. The PDF shows a small deviation from log-normal at high column densities confirming the youth of G0.253+0.016. Its lack of star formation is consistent with the theoretically predicted, environmentally dependent volume density threshold for star formation which is orders of magnitude higher than that derived for solar neighborhood clouds. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that the current theoretical understanding of molecular cloud structure derived from the solar neighborhood also holds in high-pressure environments. We therefore suggest that these theories may be applicable to understand star formation in the early universe. ...(9)",2014,"Clusters are the building blocks of galaxies and the nurseries of most stellar systems. Despite their importance, even the fundamental question of whether a single mechanism can describe cluster formation across the mass range from open clusters to globular clusters remains unclear. Answering this question requires observations of a cluster's natal dust and gas well before the onset of star formation. We have identified an extreme molecular cloud that appears to be on the verge of forming a massive cluster. This cloud, G0.25+0.02, is very cold, massive, and dense with no obvious star formation and shows tantalizing evidence that it is highly substructured and, thus, may be undergoing hierarchical fragmentation. Using the ALMA early science extended configuration we aim to obtain a ~3 x 1 arcmin mosaic of the dust continuum and molecular line emission across this cloud at 90 GHz. These observations will reveal the location, mass, and kinematics of the small-scale fragments within the cloud allowing us to distinguish between competing cluster formation models. These observations can only be achieved with the order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and dynamic range provided by ALMA. Determining whether clusters form via a single mechanism across the entire mass range has profound implications: if confirmed, this implies our knowledge of nearby cluster formation can be used as framework to understand star formation across cosmic time, back to globular clusters ~10Gyr ago. We speculate that the cloud G0.25+0.02 may represent the precursor to a modern day globular cluster.",G0.25+0.02 90 GHz,"Longmore, Steven; Alves, Joao; Walsh, Andrew; Purcell, Cormac; Bally, John; Bressert, Eli; Carey, Sean; Foster, Jonathan; Ascenso, Joana; Jackson, James; Testi, Leonardo; Bastian, Nate;",2.8980342893390234,0.05847099784421341,1.771744966506958,,uid://A002/X391d0b/X7b,uid://A002/X47aefc/X369,Globular cluster formation: caught in the act,S,TARGET,T,17.537125098924072,1875000000.0,A003:DA41 A004:DV04 A008:DV19 A011:DV12 A020:DV20 A021:DV08 A025:DV14 A046:DV09 A050:DA42 A053:DV18 A067:DA46 A068:DA44 A069:DV16 A070:DA45 A071:DV10 A072:DV13 A074:DV15 A075:DA43 A076:PM03 A077:DV02 A080:DV21 A137:DV03 A138:DV17 T702:PM02 T704:PM01,T,2013-09-07T18:53:00.000,1.516526090624047,"[86.27..88.14GHz,976.56kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,115.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.15..90.03GHz,976.56kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,115.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [98.20..100.07GHz,976.56kHz,2.8mJy/beam@10km/s,115.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [100.15..102.03GHz,976.56kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,121.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",89.09111426892694,2869.5331391039977,"Rathborne, Jill",A Cluster in the Making: ALMA Reveals the Initial Conditions for High-mass Cluster Formation A wind-blown bubble in the Central Molecular Zone cloud G0.253+0.016 ALMA View of G0.253+0.016: Can Cloud-Cloud Collision form the Cloud?

Xue, Ci; Remijan, Anthony J.; Burkhardt, Andrew M.; Herbst, Eric","Aminoacetonitrile (NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) was detected in the interstellar medium (ISM) one decade ago in the course of a spectral survey of the hot molecular core Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) with the IRAM 30 m telescope. With the advent of sensitive telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the degree of chemical complexity in the ISM can be further explored. In the family of aminoacetonitrile, the next stage in complexity with one additional CH<SUB>2</SUB> group is aminopropionitrile. This molecule has two structural isomers, a chain-like (3-aminopropionitrile, NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) and a branched, chiral one (2-aminopropionitrile, CH<SUB>3</SUB>CH(NH<SUB>2</SUB>) CN). The latter was studied in the laboratory a few years ago and was not detected in the IRAM 30 m survey. We present the search for both isomers in the EMoCA (Exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA) survey, a sensitive spectral survey of Sgr B2(N) performed with ALMA. The rotational spectrum of 3-aminopropionitrile has been recorded in laboratory with a submillimeter spectrometer using solid-state sources. Helped by ab initio calculations performed for the different possible conformations, we present here the analysis based on a Watson Hamiltonian for an asymmetric one-top rotor in A-reduction performed in the frequency range 150-500 GHz for two conformers. More than 6200 lines of the ground-state and lowest excited vibrational states, corresponding to more than 8200 transitions, were assigned in the experimental spectrum. Partition functions, including the vibrational contribution of these states, and predictions in the JPL-CDMS catalog format were determined in order to search for both conformers of 3-aminopropionitrile in Sgr B2(N). Neither 3-aminopropionitrile, nor 2-aminopropionitrile are detected. The derived upper limits imply that they are at least 12 and 5 times less abundant than aminoacetonitrile, respectively. A comparison to ethyl cyanide and n-propyl cyanide detected in this source suggests that an improvement by a factor three in sensitivity may be sufficient to detect 3-aminopropionitrile, which should be within the range of our on-going follow-up project with ALMA. ...(20)",2014,"The search for complex pre-biotic and biotic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) will be a primary focus of ALMA science. The molecular inventory of meteorites found on Earth includes more than 80 distinct amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), and their composition suggests an interstellar origin. The key search site for new complex organics in the ISM is the hot dense core Sgr B2(N), due partly to its high column density. However, the firm identification of new molecules requires a robust spectral model to unweave the emission lines of weakly-emitting, more complex, species from known molecules. We have already constructed a unique model of this kind, using our previous single-dish line survey, which has already allowed our team to uncover several new species. We propose to use ALMA Early Science to perform a deep, unbiased line survey of Sgr B2(N) in band 3 (8 hours observing time). The proposed survey will improve the detection threshold for complex organic molecules by nearly a factor of 20 compared to our previous survey of this source. Such a sensitivity improvement should lead to the firm detection of a few, perhaps a dozen, new complex organics, while the adaptation of our existing spectral model will allow a rapid turn-around from detection to publication. The use of our team's cutting edge chemical models will allow the broader implications of new discoveries to be understood, and place strong constraints on chemical formation pathways.

Depending upon the mass of this gas reservoir, the fate of the CND (whether it will it form stars, or eventually accrete on the black hole) will have a substantial impact on the evolution of the central parsec of our Galaxy. Its fate depends upon its density: gas clumps with densities > 10^7 cm^-3 are stable, and can collapse and form stars, whereas unstable clumps should quickly be sheared apart and eventually accrete onto the black hole. We propose to use the resolution and sensitivity of Cycle 2 ALMA to conduct a robust probe of gas density on the scales of individual clumps (1"", or 0.04 pc) via simultaneous excitation analyses of multiple tracers and the inclusion of radiative excitation. Ultimately, this study will yield the authoritative values for the CND mass and density, quantities which vary in recent literature by 3-4 orders of magnitude, and will indicate the amount of gas present in the central parsecs, and whether it will feed the central black hole or contribute to a nuclear starburst.",Circumnu_a_03_TE,"Harada, Nanase; Zhao, Jun-Hui; Morris, Mark; Wardle, Mark; Riquelme, Denise; Moser, Lydia; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Ho, Paul; Martin, Sergio; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Guesten, Rolf; Ginsburg, Adam;",5.566983893620921,0.11047035305672204,2.2251217365264893,uid://A001/X121/X2e0,uid://A001/X121/X2e1,uid://A002/X87544a/X22d1,The Density (and Destiny) of the Circumnuclear Disk,S,TARGET,T,8.39262237020997,1875000000.0,A007:DV23 A011:DV22 A016:DA62 A021:DA59 A031:DV11 A033:DV18 A044:DV09 A045:DA50 A056:DV25 A058:DA46 A063:DA54 A067:DV13 A069:DV16 A071:DV10 A072:DV01 A073:DV08 A074:DA47 A075:DA61 A077:DV19 A078:DV04 A079:DA41 A081:DA42 A083:DV14 A085:DA64 A086:DV07 A087:DV02 A088:DA65 A089:DV15 A090:DA60 A091:DA43 A093:DV24 A094:DV12 T701:PM03 T703:PM04,T,2015-09-23T18:00:49.000,1.060442320860106,"[85.56..87.43GHz,1128.91kHz,5.6mJy/beam@10km/s,220.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.49..89.37GHz,1128.91kHz,5.6mJy/beam@10km/s,220.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.56..99.43GHz,1128.91kHz,5.3mJy/beam@10km/s,221.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.56..101.43GHz,1128.91kHz,5.2mJy/beam@10km/s,221.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",88.43199395337612,3336.663159413489,"Mills, Elisabeth",,,T,,"Starbursts, star formation, Galactic centres/nuclei",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,ari_l,HCO+ (1-0)

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_7M,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",87.82645131893493,1.7264628290144566,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X121/X4bc,uid://A002/X85b7b2/Xb3,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,TARGET,T,90.12415312315139,1992187500.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J506:CM05 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2015-08-29T01:53:46.000,12.868083618201824,"[88.48..90.47GHz,488.28kHz,87.8mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.29..92.28GHz,488.28kHz,87mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.37..102.36GHz,488.28kHz,82.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.23..104.22GHz,488.28kHz,87.1mJy/beam@10km/s,3.6mJy/beam@native, XX]",89.47851885429894,1404.5227716097966,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

In particular, cloud-cloud collision initiated by the bar-driven inflow of molecular clouds or by feedback from past active star formation may be efficient formation process of stellar clusters cluster. Recently we detected a peculiar molecular clump not associated with major star forming GMC complexes. The clump CO-0.30-0.7 has a extremely large velocity width of 120 km/s, indicating that the entire clump is disturbed by shock possibly caused by interaction with an adjacent large expanding shell. Interestingly, the clump also has a compact core of 300-500 solar masses with narrow line width (20 km/s), which is virialized and hence capable of forming stars. At present no sign of star formation is detected toward the clump, and we speculate this is a region where cloud-cloud collision has just started, which may possibly lead cluster formation, or destruction of cloud cores. We propose imaging of this clump to resolve small-scale structures of this clump and investigate how turbulence effects on the physical properties of them.",CO-0.30-_b_06_7M,"Oka, Tomoharu; Nagai, Makoto; Miura, Kodai; Kamegai, Kazuhisa; Takekawa, Shunya;",27.884110952413636,1.3708528669398587,1.7999999523162842,uid://A001/X136/X78,uid://A001/X136/X7b,uid://A002/X879b80/Xf77,Star Formation in a Highly Turbulent Massive Clump in the Galactic Center,S,TARGET,T,27.36732728167185,250000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N604:CM11 N605:CM04,T,2016-03-06T00:00:00.000,4.639071111613694,"[264.24..266.16GHz,31250.00kHz,28mJy/beam@10km/s,1.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [265.04..265.54GHz,488.28kHz,28mJy/beam@10km/s,3.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [265.64..266.14GHz,488.28kHz,28mJy/beam@10km/s,3.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [266.71..266.96GHz,488.28kHz,27.9mJy/beam@10km/s,5.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [267.28..267.53GHz,488.28kHz,27.9mJy/beam@10km/s,5.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [267.43..267.68GHz,488.28kHz,27.9mJy/beam@10km/s,5.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",267.55730460430516,546.8665220873812,"Tanaka, Kunihiko",,,T,,High-mass star formation,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,HCO+ (3-2)

Depending upon the mass of this gas reservoir, the fate of the CND (whether it will it form stars, or eventually accrete on the black hole) will have a substantial impact on the evolution of the central parsec of our Galaxy. Its fate depends upon its density: gas clumps with densities > 10^7 cm^-3 are stable, and can collapse and form stars, whereas unstable clumps should quickly be sheared apart and eventually accrete onto the black hole. We propose to use the resolution and sensitivity of Cycle 2 ALMA to conduct a robust probe of gas density on the scales of individual clumps (1"", or 0.04 pc) via simultaneous excitation analyses of multiple tracers and the inclusion of radiative excitation. Ultimately, this study will yield the authoritative values for the CND mass and density, quantities which vary in recent literature by 3-4 orders of magnitude, and will indicate the amount of gas present in the central parsecs, and whether it will feed the central black hole or contribute to a nuclear starburst.",Circumnu_a_06_7M,"Harada, Nanase; Zhao, Jun-Hui; Morris, Mark; Wardle, Mark; Riquelme, Denise; Moser, Lydia; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Ho, Paul; Martin, Sergio; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Guesten, Rolf; Ginsburg, Adam;",31.29672288161179,1.0690872164316558,1.7999999523162842,uid://A001/X121/X2d9,uid://A001/X121/X2dc,uid://A002/X87c075/X2c43,The Density (and Destiny) of the Circumnuclear Disk,S,TARGET,T,32.959117266518234,1992187500.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J506:CM05 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04,T,2015-12-06T16:43:59.000,4.612242330949444,"[251.48..253.47GHz,1128.91kHz,32mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [253.72..255.72GHz,1128.91kHz,31.9mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [265.72..267.72GHz,1128.91kHz,31.3mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [268.71..270.70GHz,1128.91kHz,34.6mJy/beam@10km/s,2.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",266.7200464205026,1250.2487474173993,"Mills, Elisabeth",,,T,,"Starbursts, star formation, Galactic centres/nuclei",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,HCO+ (3-2)

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_TC,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",14.16672152910387,0.28517373917287614,4.546826362609863,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X121/X4ba,uid://A002/X95e355/X1f13,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,TARGET,T,28.860732445758064,1875000000.0,A001:DA58 A002:DV16 A003:DV21 A004:DV24 A005:DV25 A006:DA42 A011:DV22 A013:DA51 A015:DV18 A016:DV04 A017:DA57 A018:DA63 A019:DA54 A021:DA59 A023:DV11 A024:DV10 A026:DV09 A027:DV13 A029:DA49 A030:DA45 A031:DV08 A033:DV19 A034:DV20 A035:DA52 A036:DA60 A037:DV12 A038:DV07 A040:DA43 A042:DV17 A043:DA48 A044:DV15 A046:DA62 A050:DV14 A058:DA46 A060:DA55 A062:DV05 A066:DA64 A068:DA44 A069:DA53 A070:DA47 A071:DA50 A072:DV01 A075:DA61 A137:DA41 T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,T,2016-06-07T02:44:17.000,2.1144830360503604,"[88.54..90.42GHz,488.28kHz,14.2mJy/beam@10km/s,565.2uJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.34..92.22GHz,488.28kHz,14mJy/beam@10km/s,565.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.43..102.30GHz,488.28kHz,13.4mJy/beam@10km/s,568.2uJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.29..104.16GHz,488.28kHz,13.6mJy/beam@10km/s,583.1uJy/beam@native, XX]",89.4785054011293,1405.1483871501034,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_TC,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",3.404901778607944,0.06851741707258369,2.9773616790771484,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X121/X4ba,uid://A002/X9cffbd/Xefe,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,PHASE WVR,F,24.364476966197678,1875000000.0,A001:DA58 A003:DV21 A004:DV24 A005:DV25 A011:DV22 A013:DA51 A015:DV18 A017:DA57 A018:DA63 A019:DA54 A021:DA59 A023:DV11 A024:DV10 A026:DV09 A027:DV13 A029:DA49 A030:DA45 A031:DV08 A033:DV19 A034:DV20 A035:DA52 A036:DA60 A037:DV12 A038:DV07 A042:DV17 A043:DA48 A046:DA62 A058:DA46 A062:DV05 A066:DA64 A068:DA44 A069:DA53 A070:DA47 A071:DA50 A072:DV01 A075:DA61 A137:DA41 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,F,2016-06-07T02:44:17.000,2.247382573638136,"[88.54..90.42GHz,488.28kHz,3.4mJy/beam@10km/s,135.8uJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.35..92.22GHz,488.28kHz,3.4mJy/beam@10km/s,135.9uJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.43..102.30GHz,488.28kHz,3.2mJy/beam@10km/s,136.2uJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.29..104.16GHz,488.28kHz,3.3mJy/beam@10km/s,140.4uJy/beam@native, XX]",89.47861347231942,1405.1483871501034,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

In this proposal, we want to do a full line survey of Band 6 toward both sources, to determine the full physical and chemical structure using 3-d radiative transfer modeling, to identify all lines and possibly find new species, and to characterize the chemical diversity spatially.

This will be aided by the availability of full HIFI line surveys of both sources, which will give important constraints.",sgrb2_n_b_06_TE,"Schmiedeke, Anika; Bergin, Edwin; Sanchez-Monge, Alvaro; Müller, Holger; Qin, Sheng-Li; Lis, Dariusz; Comito, Claudia;",1.627261335617746,0.02428822917904063,1.2611926794052124,uid://A001/X12b/X14,uid://A001/X12b/X15,uid://A002/X835491/X817,Physical and chemical structure of massive proto-clusters,S,TARGET WVR,T,5.263992638087354,1875000000.0,A007:DV22 A007:DV23 A010:DV02 A010:DV12 A011:DV04 A011:DV22 A015:DV18 A016:DA62 A017:DA57 A019:DA63 A021:DA59 A029:DA49 A031:DV08 A031:DV11 A033:DV18 A033:DV19 A034:DV20 A035:DA52 A036:DA60 A038:DV07 A042:DV17 A046:DA48 A046:DA62 A056:DV25 A058:DA46 A062:DV05 A063:DA54 A066:DA64 A067:DV13 A067:DV21 A068:DA44 A069:DA53 A069:DV16 A070:DA45 A070:DA47 A071:DV10 A072:DV01 A073:DA63 A074:DA47 A074:DV10 A075:DA61 A076:DA57 A077:DV16 A078:DV04 A078:DV15 A079:DA43 A080:DA55 A080:DV24 A081:DA42 A081:DV09 A082:DA51 A083:DV14 A083:DV25 A084:DV11 A085:DA51 A085:DA64 A087:DV02 A087:DV23 A090:DA60 A091:DA43 A137:DA41 A138:DV14 A138:DV17 T701:PM03 T703:PM04,F,2016-08-07T11:05:20.000,0.5020280348497802,"[240.12..242.00GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108uJy/beam@native, XX] U [241.99..243.88GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108.1uJy/beam@native, XX] U [243.87..245.75GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108.2uJy/beam@native, XX] U [245.74..247.63GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108.3uJy/beam@native, XX] U [247.62..249.50GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [249.49..251.38GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108.5uJy/beam@native, XX] U [251.37..253.25GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108.6uJy/beam@native, XX] U [253.24..255.13GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,106.9uJy/beam@native, XX] U [255.12..257.00GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107uJy/beam@native, XX] U [256.12..258.00GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107uJy/beam@native, XX] U [256.99..258.87GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107.1uJy/beam@native, XX] U [257.99..259.87GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107.1uJy/beam@native, XX] U [259.87..261.75GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107.3uJy/beam@native, XX] U [261.74..263.62GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [263.62..265.50GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107.5uJy/beam@native, XX] U [265.49..267.37GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107.6uJy/beam@native, XX] U [267.37..269.25GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,112.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [269.24..271.12GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,112.5uJy/beam@native, XX] U [271.12..273.00GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,112.7uJy/beam@native, XX] U [272.99..274.87GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,112.8uJy/beam@native, XX]",268.3078513624445,615.5878353506134,"Schilke, Peter",STATCONT: A statistical continuum level determination method for line-rich sources The physical and chemical structure of Sagittarius B2.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_TE,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",2.729130899249264,0.05496521185966593,3.1221659183502197,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X121/X4b8,uid://A002/Xa4ce71/X49f,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,PHASE WVR,F,5.076291026134417,1875000000.0,A011:DV04 A015:DV18 A021:DA59 A029:DA49 A033:DV19 A058:DA46 A060:DA55 A064:DA50 A069:DA53 A072:DV01 A073:DA63 A075:DA61 A076:DV13 A077:DV16 A078:DV15 A079:DA43 A080:DV24 A082:DA42 A083:DV25 A084:DV05 A085:DA51 A086:DV14 A087:DV23 A088:DV20 A089:DA60 A090:DA54 A091:DA58 A093:DV21 A094:DV02 A096:DV10 A097:DA62 A101:DA47 A103:DV03 A104:DA44 A105:DA52 A107:DA64 A110:DV22 A112:DV07 A113:DA57 A115:DV11 A135:DA45 A136:DV17 A137:DA41,F,2017-11-05T00:00:00.000,0.46302702737609197,"[88.54..90.42GHz,488.28kHz,2.7mJy/beam@10km/s,108.9uJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.34..92.22GHz,488.28kHz,2.7mJy/beam@10km/s,108.9uJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.43..102.30GHz,488.28kHz,2.6mJy/beam@10km/s,109.2uJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.29..104.16GHz,488.28kHz,2.6mJy/beam@10km/s,112.9uJy/beam@native, XX]",89.47845203493928,1405.3113217795521,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

These are new features of the Galactic Center -- never seen before ALMA pointed at the Brick, and we don't know what they are. The features are almost unbelievable -- unresolved (<1.7'') in the narrow dimension and 30 to 50'' long with absorption seen over 20 km/s. We propose a quick and simple experiment to test two theories for the origin of these filaments: (1) ram-pressure confined shocks or (2) magnetic confinement of ions.

We speculate that they are leftovers of more massive molecular clouds that fall into the cavity and are tidally disrupted, or that they originate from instabilities in the inner rim of the CND that lead to fragmentation and infall from there. In either case, we show that molecular cloudlets, all together with a mass of several 10 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, exist around Sgr A<SUP>*</SUP>. Most of them must be short-lived, ≲10<SUP>4</SUP> yr: photoevaporated by the intense stellar radiation field, G<SUB>0</SUB> ≃ 10<SUP>5.3</SUP>-10<SUP>4.3</SUP>, blown away by winds from massive stars in the central cluster, or disrupted by strong gravitational shears.

We will use ALMA to resolve the spatial structures and kinematical patterns associated with the high-velocity CO line emission at the interface between the circum-nuclear disk and the inner central cavity. This component is beam diluted in our single-dish Herschel observations of the complete CO rotational ladder but can be inferred from the line profiles. Our observations using all 3 instruments on board Herschel have also revealed the presence of overabundant H2O and OH, as well as unexpected hot CO in the vicinity of SgrA*. We wish to understand the origin of this high velocity gas, and its heating and ionisation sources, using ALMA to search for the key missing information and to determine both the spatial structure and the ionization fraction using well established molecular tracers (HCO+, HOC+ and SO+).",SgrA_sta_a_07_TP,"Le Petit, Franck; Gerin, Maryvonne; Lesaffre, Pierre; Bell, Tom; Cernicharo, Jose; Etxaluze , Mireya; Godard, Benjamin; Pety, Jérôme;",17.778934922409018,0.73118932867494,0.6208609342575073,uid://A001/X122/X15d,uid://A001/X148/Xb1,uid://A002/X9fa4e2/X18b4,Irradiated Shocks and Ionisation Sources in the Central Parsec of the Milky Way,S,TARGET WVR,T,264.7855844960483,1992187500.0,A072:DV01 T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,F,2017-02-25T17:32:13.000,14.938123396018268,"[344.80..346.79GHz,976.56kHz,17.9mJy/beam@10km/s,1.4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [346.19..348.18GHz,976.56kHz,17.9mJy/beam@10km/s,1.4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [356.23..358.22GHz,976.56kHz,17.8mJy/beam@10km/s,1.4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [356.93..358.92GHz,976.56kHz,25mJy/beam@10km/s,1.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",357.2219816346781,815.6044270912132,"Goicoechea, Javier",High-speed molecular cloudlets around the Galactic center's supermassive black hole,"Goicoechea, Javier R.",T,2018A&A...618A..35G,"Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds, Photon-Dominated Regions (PDR)/X-Ray Dominated Regions (XDR)",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,HCO+ (4-3)

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. We present an overview of the CMZoom survey and its first data release. CMZoom is the first blind, high-resolution survey of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; the inner 500 pc of the Milky Way) at wavelengths sensitive to the pre-cursors of high-mass stars. CMZoom is a 550 hr Large Program on the Submillimeter Array that mapped at 1.3 mm all of the gas and dust in the CMZ above a molecular hydrogen column density of 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at a resolution of ∼3″ (0.1 pc). In this paper, we focus on the 1.3 mm dust continuum and its data release, but also describe CMZoom spectral line data which will be released in a forthcoming publication. While CMZoom detected many regions with rich and complex substructure, its key result is an overall deficit in compact substructures on 0.1-2 pc scales (the compact dense gas fraction: CDGF). In comparison with clouds in the Galactic disk, the CDGF in the CMZ is substantially lower, despite having much higher average column densities. CMZ clouds with high CDGFs are well-known sites of active star formation. The inability of most gas in the CMZ to form compact substructures is likely responsible for the dearth of star formation in the CMZ, surprising considering its high density. The factors responsible for the low CDGF are not yet understood but are plausibly due to the extreme environment of the CMZ, having far-reaching ramifications for our understanding of the star formation process across the cosmos. ...(1)",2019,"The ultimate goal of star formation (SF) studies is an end-to-end understanding of stellar mass assembly as a function of environment.

This proposal aims to overcome both these problems by exploiting a causally-related system of clouds in the extreme environment of the Galactic Centre. ALMA observations will allow us to test whether SF has been triggered in these clouds by close passage to the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential. If confirmed, this will provide a laboratory for studying stellar mass assembly as a function of absolute time, allowing us to: (i) directly test theoretical predictions of molecular cloud structure evolution in turbulent clouds; (ii) unambiguously determine how critical density thresholds for SF vary with environment; (iii) follow the mass assembly of gravitationally bound cores, including likely precursors to stars >100 Msun, thereby directly testing SF theories at the most extreme mass ranges.",Clouds_E_a_06_TE,"Alves, Joao; Molinari, Sergio; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Bonnell, Ian; Rathborne, Jill; Ginsburg, Adam; Beltran, Maite; Walker, Daniel; Gomez, Laura; Walsh, Andrew; Hill, Tracey; Mills, Elisabeth; Peters, Thomas; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Kainulainen, Jouni; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; Chrysostomou, Antonio; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett;",8.153913313857675,0.2762646357279108,3.976219415664673,uid://A001/X197/Xb6,uid://A001/X197/Xb7,uid://A002/X9f2ff8/X11bd,"Extreme Star Formation ""The Movie"": the early assembly of monster stars and clusters caught in action",S,TARGET,T,9.44358423997806,1875000000.0,A001:DA58 A002:DV16 A004:DV24 A005:DV25 A010:DV02 A013:DA51 A015:DV18 A016:DV04 A017:DA57 A018:DA63 A019:DA54 A021:DA59 A023:DV11 A024:DV10 A027:DV13 A029:DA49 A030:DA45 A031:DV08 A033:DV19 A034:DV20 A036:DA60 A037:DV12 A038:DV07 A040:DA43 A042:DV17 A044:DV15 A046:DA62 A050:DV14 A058:DA46 A060:DA55 A062:DV05 A066:DA64 A067:DV21 A068:DA44 A069:DA53 A070:DA47 A071:DA50 A075:DA61 A137:DA41,T,2017-08-05T00:00:00.000,0.8593939594719865,"[249.56..251.44GHz,1128.91kHz,8.3mJy/beam@10km/s,555.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [251.56..253.44GHz,1128.91kHz,8.1mJy/beam@10km/s,544.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [264.56..266.44GHz,1128.91kHz,8mJy/beam@10km/s,548.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [266.56..268.44GHz,1128.91kHz,8.2mJy/beam@10km/s,562.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",267.49987516739367,1260.629068905023,"Longmore, Steven",CMZoom.

However, little is known about the formation of the most massive clusters. In recent surveys, one object, G0.25+0.02, stands out as extreme. Identified as a cold, dense, massive molecular clump devoid of current star-formation, it has exactly the properties expected for a clump that may form an Arches-like massive cluster. Our wealth of ancillary data reveals tantalising evidence that it is highly structured and, thus, may be undergoing hierarchical fragmentation. Surprisingly, while its dust temperature is very low (20 K), the detection of complex molecules that arise from hot gas suggests that the gas temperature within G0.25+0.02 may be > 50K. This discrepancy is puzzling and may provide clues as to how this protocluster formed and whether star formation can progress within it. The proposed ALMA observations will reveal the distribution, physical conditions, and kinematics of both the cold dust and hot gas within G0.25+0.02 on small scales and allow us to determine its formation history. These observations can only be achieved with the order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and dynamic range provided by ALMA.

Depending upon the mass of this gas reservoir, the fate of the CND (whether it will it form stars, or eventually accrete on the black hole) will have a substantial impact on the evolution of the central parsec of our Galaxy. Its fate depends upon its density: gas clumps with densities > 10^7 cm^-3 are stable, and can collapse and form stars, whereas unstable clumps should quickly be sheared apart and eventually accrete onto the black hole. We propose to use the resolution and sensitivity of Cycle 2 ALMA to conduct a robust probe of gas density on the scales of individual clumps (1"", or 0.04 pc) via simultaneous excitation analyses of multiple tracers and the inclusion of radiative excitation.

Gerin, M.; Liszt, H.; Neufeld, D.; Godard, B.; Sonnentrucker, P.; Pety, J.; Roueff, E.","<BR /> Aims: The transition between atomic and molecular hydrogen is associated with important changes in the structure of interstellar clouds, and marks the beginning of interstellar chemistry. Most molecular ions are rapidly formed (in ion-molecule reactions) and destroyed (by dissociative recombination) in the diffuse ISM. Because of the relatively simple networks controlling their abundances, molecular ions are usually good probes of the underlying physical conditions including, for instance the fraction of gas in molecular form or the fractional ionization. In this paper we focus on three possible probes of the molecular hydrogen column density, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP>. <BR /> Methods: We presented high-sensitivity ALMA absorption data toward a sample of compact H II regions and bright QSOs with prominent foreground absorption, in the ground-state transitions of the molecular ions HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> and the neutral species HCN and HNC, and from the excited-state transitions of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(4-3) and <SUP>13</SUP>CS(2-1). These data are compared with Herschel absorption spectra of the ground-state transition of HF and p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O. <BR /> Results: We show that the HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> column densities are well correlated with each other. HCO<SUP>+</SUP> and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> are tightly correlated with p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O, while they exhibit a different correlation pattern with HF depending on whether the absorbing matter is located in the Galactic disk or in the central molecular zone. We report new detections of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> confirming that this ion is ubiquitous in the diffuse matter, with an abundance relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> of 7 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: We confirm that the CF<SUP>+</SUP> abundance is lower than predicted by simple chemical models and propose that the rate of the main formation reaction is lower by a factor of about 3 than usually assumed. In the absence of CH or HF data, we recommend to use the ground-state transitions of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, CCH, and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> to trace diffuse molecular hydrogen, with mean abundances relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> of 3 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>, 4 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP>, and 4 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>, respectively, leading to sensitivity N(H<SUB>2</SUB>)/ ∫ τdv of 4 × 10<SUP>20</SUP>, 1.5 × 10<SUP>21</SUP>, and 6 × 10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> /km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively.

It can be followed in C+, in emission at 1.9 THz, but we propose a more accessible probe of C+ by following gas-phase fluorine into HF and CF+. When H2 is present, fluorine concentrates into HF exothermically via F+H2->HF+H and forms CF+ via C+ + HF->CF+ + H, making CF+ the 2nd largest fluorine reservoir where C+ and H2 coexist. Since HF tracks H2, CF+ is a perfect tracer of the H I-> H2 transition. Recent observations toward the Horsehead and the bright QSOs BLLAC and 3C111 illustrate this in the science case. We propose to use ALMA to perform an exploratory survey of CF+ absorption in the inner galactic plane using well characterized sight-lines towards continuum sources studied in the Herschel PRISMAS survey and other means.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_TP,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",27.95034064579513,0.5194349368710425,4.389588832855225,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X147/X92,uid://A002/X9a755e/X1f06,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,TARGET WVR,T,966.9477008976131,1992187500.0,A072:DV01 T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,F,2017-01-13T21:39:57.000,54.55125132267276,"[88.48..90.47GHz,488.28kHz,28mJy/beam@10km/s,1.1mJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.29..92.28GHz,488.28kHz,26.2mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.37..102.36GHz,488.28kHz,24.9mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.23..104.22GHz,488.28kHz,24.7mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX]",89.4784985332025,1404.3678052678852,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. We present an overview of the CMZoom survey and its first data release. CMZoom is the first blind, high-resolution survey of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; the inner 500 pc of the Milky Way) at wavelengths sensitive to the pre-cursors of high-mass stars. CMZoom is a 550 hr Large Program on the Submillimeter Array that mapped at 1.3 mm all of the gas and dust in the CMZ above a molecular hydrogen column density of 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at a resolution of ∼3″ (0.1 pc). In this paper, we focus on the 1.3 mm dust continuum and its data release, but also describe CMZoom spectral line data which will be released in a forthcoming publication. While CMZoom detected many regions with rich and complex substructure, its key result is an overall deficit in compact substructures on 0.1-2 pc scales (the compact dense gas fraction: CDGF). In comparison with clouds in the Galactic disk, the CDGF in the CMZ is substantially lower, despite having much higher average column densities. CMZ clouds with high CDGFs are well-known sites of active star formation. The inability of most gas in the CMZ to form compact substructures is likely responsible for the dearth of star formation in the CMZ, surprising considering its high density. The factors responsible for the low CDGF are not yet understood but are plausibly due to the extreme environment of the CMZ, having far-reaching ramifications for our understanding of the star formation process across the cosmos. ...(1)",2019,"The ultimate goal of star formation (SF) studies is an end-to-end understanding of stellar mass assembly as a function of environment. Existing observations have two fundamental limitations reaching this goal: they predominantly focus on regions in similar environments, and observations of a region only provides a single evolutionary snapshot. This proposal aims to overcome both these problems by exploiting a causally-related system of clouds in the extreme environment of the Galactic Centre. ALMA observations will allow us to test whether SF has been triggered in these clouds by close passage to the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential. If confirmed, this will provide a laboratory for studying stellar mass assembly as a function of absolute time, allowing us to: (i) directly test theoretical predictions of molecular cloud structure evolution in turbulent clouds; (ii) unambiguously determine how critical density thresholds for SF vary with environment; (iii) follow the mass assembly of gravitationally bound cores, including likely precursors to stars >100 Msun, thereby directly testing SF theories at the most extreme mass ranges.",Clouds_E_a_06_7M,"Alves, Joao; Molinari, Sergio; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Bonnell, Ian; Rathborne, Jill; Ginsburg, Adam; Beltran, Maite; Walker, Daniel; Gomez, Laura; Walsh, Andrew; Hill, Tracey; Mills, Elisabeth; Peters, Thomas; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Kainulainen, Jouni; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; Chrysostomou, Antonio; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett;",63.787150518947456,1.9383094431798014,1.7999999523162842,uid://A001/X197/Xb6,uid://A001/X197/Xb9,uid://A002/Xa8666f/X1f3,"Extreme Star Formation ""The Movie"": the early assembly of monster stars and clusters caught in action",S,TARGET,T,30.507326268924952,1992187500.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2016-10-09T16:43:29.000,3.3401528864722163,"[249.50..251.50GHz,1128.91kHz,58.1mJy/beam@10km/s,3.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [251.50..253.50GHz,1128.91kHz,57.9mJy/beam@10km/s,3.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [264.50..266.50GHz,1128.91kHz,56.7mJy/beam@10km/s,3.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [266.50..268.50GHz,1128.91kHz,63.8mJy/beam@10km/s,4.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",267.49993844540995,1260.5571785734476,"Longmore, Steven",CMZoom.

Depending upon the mass of this gas reservoir, the fate of the CND (whether it will it form stars, or eventually accrete on the black hole) will have a substantial impact on the evolution of the central parsec of our Galaxy. Its fate depends upon its density: gas clumps with densities > 10^7 cm^-3 are stable, and can collapse and form stars, whereas unstable clumps should quickly be sheared apart and eventually accrete onto the black hole. We propose to use the resolution and sensitivity of Cycle 2 ALMA to conduct a robust probe of gas density on the scales of individual clumps (1"", or 0.04 pc) via simultaneous excitation analyses of multiple tracers and the inclusion of radiative excitation. Ultimately, this study will yield the authoritative values for the CND mass and density, quantities which vary in recent literature by 3-4 orders of magnitude, and will indicate the amount of gas present in the central parsecs, and whether it will feed the central black hole or contribute to a nuclear starburst.",Circumnu_a_03_7M,"Harada, Nanase; Zhao, Jun-Hui; Morris, Mark; Wardle, Mark; Riquelme, Denise; Moser, Lydia; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Ho, Paul; Martin, Sergio; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Guesten, Rolf; Ginsburg, Adam;",18.733597662692183,0.3667314188227084,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X121/X2e0,uid://A001/X121/X2e5,uid://A002/X88e746/X735,The Density (and Destiny) of the Circumnuclear Disk,S,TARGET,T,83.53792144937451,1992187500.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2016-01-02T15:03:55.000,12.75856827810072,"[85.50..87.49GHz,1128.91kHz,18.9mJy/beam@10km/s,720.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.44..89.43GHz,1128.91kHz,18.7mJy/beam@10km/s,720.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.50..99.49GHz,1128.91kHz,17.8mJy/beam@10km/s,721.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.50..101.49GHz,1128.91kHz,18.9mJy/beam@10km/s,774.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",88.43189199023072,3334.8025148381857,"Mills, Elisabeth",,,T,,"Starbursts, star formation, Galactic centres/nuclei",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,HCO+ (1-0)

The images unveil the presence of small spatial scale <SUP>12</SUP>CO (J = 3-2) molecular ""cloudlets"" (≲20 000 AU size) within the central parsec of the Milky Way, in other words, inside the cavity of the CND, and moving at high speeds, up to 300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> along the line-of-sight. The <SUP>12</SUP>CO-emitting structures show intricate morphologies: extended and filamentary at high negative-velocities (v<SUB>LSR</SUB> ≲-150 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), more localized and clumpy at extreme positive-velocities (v<SUB>LSR</SUB> ≳+200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). Based on the pencil-beam <SUP>12</SUP>CO absorption spectrum toward Sgr A<SUP>*</SUP> synchrotron emission, we also present evidence for a diffuse molecular gas component producing absorption features at more extreme negative-velocities (v<SUB>LSR</SUB> &lt; -200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CND shows a clumpy spatial distribution traced by the optically thin H<SUP>13</SUP>CN (J = 4-3) emission. Its motion requires a bundle of non-uniformly rotating streams of slightly different inclinations. The inferred gas density peaks, molecular cores of several 10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, are lower than the local Roche limit. This supports that CND cores are transient. We apply the two standard orbit models, spirals vs. ellipses, invoked to explain the kinematics of the ionized gas streamers around Sgr A<SUP>*</SUP>. The location and velocities of the <SUP>12</SUP>CO cloudlets inside the cavity are inconsistent with the spiral model, and only two of them are consistent with the Keplerian ellipse model. Most cloudlets, however, show similar velocities that are incompatible with the motions of the ionized streamers or with gas bounded to the central gravity. We speculate that they are leftovers of more massive molecular clouds that fall into the cavity and are tidally disrupted, or that they originate from instabilities in the inner rim of the CND that lead to fragmentation and infall from there. In either case, we show that molecular cloudlets, all together with a mass of several 10 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, exist around Sgr A<SUP>*</SUP>. Most of them must be short-lived, ≲10<SUP>4</SUP> yr: photoevaporated by the intense stellar radiation field, G<SUB>0</SUB> ≃ 10<SUP>5.3</SUP>-10<SUP>4.3</SUP>, blown away by winds from massive stars in the central cluster, or disrupted by strong gravitational shears. This paper makes use of the following ALMA data: ADS/JAO.ALMA#2013.1.01058.S. ALMA is a partnership of ESO (representing its member states), NSF (USA), and NINS (Japan), together with NRC (Canada), and NSC and ASIAA (Taiwan), in cooperation with the Republic of Chile.

We will use ALMA to resolve the spatial structures and kinematical patterns associated with the high-velocity CO line emission at the interface between the circum-nuclear disk and the inner central cavity. This component is beam diluted in our single-dish Herschel observations of the complete CO rotational ladder but can be inferred from the line profiles. Our observations using all 3 instruments on board Herschel have also revealed the presence of overabundant H2O and OH, as well as unexpected hot CO in the vicinity of SgrA*.

One of the molecular clouds is positionally connected to part of the CND adjacent to the ""western arc."" However, the cloud is seen to rotate in the opposite direction to the CND, so it could currently be falling from the outer region to the CND and being disrupted by the tidal shear of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) because the velocity is not yet assimilated into that of the CND. Another molecular cloud is continuously connected to the tip of the ""eastern arm"" (EA). The velocity of this cloud is consistent with that of the ionized gas in the EA. These facts suggest that the molecular cloud is falling from the outer region to the vicinity of Sgr A*, being disrupted by the tidal shear, and ionized by strong UV emission from the central cluster because the impact parameter of the cloud is smaller than the first cloud. These falling clouds would play an important role in transferring material from the outer region to the CND and/or the vicinity of Sgr A*.",2018,"The inner few parsecs around Sgr~A* at the Galactic center is likely the best region to understand the physical conditions around a supermassive black hole. Even though this region has been extensively studied at all wavelengths, little is known about the amount and distribution of the densest molecular component within the ~3 pc diameter cavity observed within the circumnuclear disk (CND) of molecular material. In this cavity, ionized material streamers are observed in a ''mini-spiral'' structure. While the ionized gas seems to be associated with the CND on larger scales, we do not have sensitive enough information to establish how the molecular gas is associated with the ionized gas in the central parsec of the galaxy.

Previous works have shown that the molecular gas have two distinct velocity components, one associated with the X1-orbits and the other associated with the X2-orbits (in a barred potential model).

R.","We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array observations of the candidate jet-ISM interaction zones near the black hole X-ray binaries GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942. Using these data, we map the molecular line emission in the regions, detecting emission from the HCN [J = 1-0], HCO<SUP>+</SUP> [J = 1-0], SiO [J = 2-1], CS [J = 2-1], <SUP>13</SUP>CO [J = 1-0], C<SUP>18</SUP>O [J = 1-0], HNCO [J = 4<SUB>0,4</SUB>-3<SUB>0,3</SUB>], HNCO [J = 5<SUB>0,5</SUB>-4<SUB>0,4</SUB>], and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH [J = 2<SUB>1,1</SUB>-1<SUB>1,0</SUB>] molecular transitions. Through examining the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of this emission, we identify molecular structures that may trace jet-driven cavities in the gas surrounding these systems. Our results from the GRS 1758-258 region in particular, are consistent with recent work, which postulated the presence of a jet-blown cocoon structure in deep radio continuum maps of the region. Using these newly discovered molecular structures as calorimeters, we estimate the time averaged jet power from these systems, finding $(1.1{\!-\!}5.7)\times 10^{36}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.12-0.31 Myr for GRS 1758-258 and $(0.7{\!-\!}3.5)\times 10^{37}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.10-0.26 Myr for 1E 1740.7-2942. Additionally, the spectral line characteristics of the detected emission place these molecular structures in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy, thereby constraining the distances to the black hole X-ray binaries to be 8.0 ± 1.0 kpc. Overall, our analysis solidifies the diagnostic capacity of molecular lines, and highlights how astro-chemistry can both identify jet-ISM interaction zones and probe jet feedback from Galactic X-ray binaries.",2019,"Relativistic jets launched from accreting black holes carry large amounts of energy and matter into their surrounding environment. Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), the stellar-mass analogues of active galactic nuclei (AGN), are ideal targets for studying the interactions between the jet and the ambient ISM in detail, due to their close proximity and the rapid timescale evolution of BHXB jets. Identifying and probing the ISM properties in interaction zones provides insight into highly sought-after jet properties, such as the total jet power, composition, duty cycles, and the efficiency of jet feedback. We propose targeting the candidate interaction sites around the BHXBs, GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942, with Band 3 ALMA ACA observations. We will map the CO, SiO, CS, HCO+, HCN, and HNCO line emission over 4.5 square arcmin for each target (our targets are within 5 deg, and can thus be observed in a single execution). As these lines provide for excellent diagnostics of shock energetics and ISM excitation, we can definitively test whether these candidate zones are powered by a BHXB jet, and, if the association is confirmed, measure the injected jet power through calorimetry.",GRS_1758_b_03_7M,"Miller-Jones, James; Rosolowsky, Erik; Sivakoff, Gregory;",38.2586586434486,1.1854713505005698,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X1284/X1962,uid://A001/X1284/X1963,uid://A002/Xc64412/X2db0,Mapping Jet-ISM Interactions in X-ray Binaries,S,TARGET,T,76.34646755536733,125000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2019-07-11T00:00:00.000,11.695713052909516,"[86.72..86.97GHz,282.23kHz,37.5mJy/beam@10km/s,4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.80..88.05GHz,282.23kHz,37.3mJy/beam@10km/s,4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.57..88.69GHz,282.23kHz,37.8mJy/beam@10km/s,5.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [89.13..89.25GHz,282.23kHz,38.3mJy/beam@10km/s,5.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.73..98.23GHz,282.23kHz,37.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.01..101.00GHz,31250.00kHz,37.7mJy/beam@10km/s,1.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",89.18794016029105,865.76908099605,"Tetarenko, Alexandra",ALMACAL - VI.

Depending upon the mass of this gas reservoir, the fate of the CND (whether it will it form stars, or eventually accrete on the black hole) will have a substantial impact on the evolution of the central parsec of our Galaxy. Its fate depends upon its density: gas clumps with densities > 10^7 cm^-3 are stable, and can collapse and form stars, whereas unstable clumps should quickly be sheared apart and eventually accrete onto the black hole. We propose to use the resolution and sensitivity of Cycle 2 ALMA to conduct a robust probe of gas density on the scales of individual clumps (1"", or 0.04 pc) via simultaneous excitation analyses of multiple tracers and the inclusion of radiative excitation. Ultimately, this study will yield the authoritative values for the CND mass and density, quantities which vary in recent literature by 3-4 orders of magnitude, and will indicate the amount of gas present in the central parsecs, and whether it will feed the central black hole or contribute to a nuclear starburst.",Circumnu_a_06_TP,"Harada, Nanase; Zhao, Jun-Hui; Morris, Mark; Wardle, Mark; Riquelme, Denise; Moser, Lydia; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Ho, Paul; Martin, Sergio; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Guesten, Rolf; Ginsburg, Adam;",16.20488157746647,0.5658355632061385,1.351098895072937,uid://A001/X121/X2d9,uid://A001/X121/X2de,uid://A002/Xa16f89/X10bb,The Density (and Destiny) of the Circumnuclear Disk,S,TARGET WVR,T,356.8358496255691,1992187500.0,T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,F,2016-10-16T17:41:45.000,20.131225191083388,"[251.48..253.47GHz,1128.91kHz,18.2mJy/beam@10km/s,1.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [253.72..255.71GHz,1128.91kHz,18.2mJy/beam@10km/s,1.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [265.73..267.72GHz,1128.91kHz,16.2mJy/beam@10km/s,1.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [268.71..270.70GHz,1128.91kHz,16.1mJy/beam@10km/s,1.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",266.72100487613415,1250.1250557012945,"Mills, Elisabeth",,,T,,"Starbursts, star formation, Galactic centres/nuclei",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,HCO+ (3-2)

Aminoacetonitrile, a molecule detected in the interstellar medium only toward the star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), is considered an important prebiotic species; in particular, it is a possible precursor of the simplest amino acid glycine. To date, observations have been limited to ground state emission lines, whereas transitions from within vibrationally excited states remained undetected. <BR /> Aims: We wanted to accurately determine the energies of the low-lying vibrational states of aminoacetonitrile, which are expected to be populated in Sgr B2(N1), the main hot core of Sgr B2(N). This step is fundamental in order to properly evaluate the vibration-rotation partition function of aminoacetonitrile as well as the line strengths of the rotational transitions of its vibrationally excited states. This is necessary to derive accurate column densities and secure the identification of these transitions in astronomical spectra. <BR /> Methods: The far-infrared ro-vibrational spectrum of aminoacetonitrile has been recorded in absorption against a synchrotron source of continuum emission. Three bands, corresponding to the lowest vibrational modes of aminoacetonitrile, were observed in the frequency region below 500 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The combined analysis of ro-vibrational and pure rotational data allowed us to prepare new spectral line catalogs for all the states under investigation. We used the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA performed with ALMA to search for vibrationally excited aminoacetonitrile toward Sgr B2(N1). The astronomical spectra were analyzed under the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation. <BR /> Results: Almost 11 000 lines have been assigned during the analysis of the laboratory spectrum of aminoacetonitrile, thanks to which the vibrational energies of the v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1, v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1, and v<SUB>17</SUB> = 1 states have been determined. The whole dataset, which includes high J and K<SUB>a</SUB> transitions, is well reproduced within the experimental accuracy. Reliable spectral predictions of pure rotational lines can now be produced up to the THz region. On the basis of these spectroscopic predictions, we report the interstellar detection of aminoacetonitrile in its v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 vibrational states toward Sgr B2(N1) in addition to emission from its vibrational ground state. The intensities of the identified v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 lines are consistent with the detected v = 0 lines under LTE at a temperature of 200 K for an aminoacetonitrile column density of 1.1 × 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: This work shows the strong interplay between laboratory spectroscopy exploiting (sub)millimeter and synchrotron-based far-infrared techniques, and observational spectral surveys to detect complex organic molecules in space and quantify their abundances. <P />The list of assigned transitions is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160</A> ...(6)",2019,"ALMA has had a transformational effect on the search for complex organic molecules (COMs) in star-forming regions, pushing the limits of observable chemical complexity. Our recent detection of a branched alkyl molecule in the interstellar medium (ISM) with ALMA has opened a new domain in the structures available to the chemistry of star-forming regions, beyond simple chains. Our astrochemical model was recently expanded to include branched isomers, and indicates that branched molecules may be dominant in star-forming regions where the chemistry is of sufficient complexity. We propose to perform a direct observational test of this hypothesis, in order to determine both the degree and the manner in which chemical complexity evolves during star formation. We propose to search for n-butyl cyanide and its three branched isomers toward Sgr B2(N), the most fruitful target for new detections of COMs in the ISM. The discovery of biologically-relevant molecules in the ISM is of high scientific impact.

The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.

This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"Measures of gas excitation in Galactic center molecular clouds are lacking on sub-parsec scales. Without these measurements, we lack constraints on the density structure of clouds necessary to test models of star formation in this environment and determine why so many clouds are not forming stars. We also lack a knowledge of the chemical abundance structure necessary to determine the impact of factors like shocks and cosmic rays and how they set the initial chemical conditions for star formation here. We propose to make the first survey of sub-parsec scale gas excitation in the Galactic center by observing a representative sample of clouds in Band 7 with ACA (resolution 3.5) and leveraging existing Band 3 ALMA 12m and Band 6 SMA coverage of these clouds. With 100 mK sensitivity we will detect lines of more than a dozen species, most of which are also mapped at another frequency.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.

Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding.

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2. We report the discovery of molecular gas streams orbiting around an invisible massive object in the central region of our Galaxy, based on the high-resolution molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The morphology and kinematics of these streams can be reproduced well through two Keplerian orbits around a single point mass of (3.2 ± 0.6) × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB>. We also found ionized gas toward the inner part of the orbiting gas, indicating dissociative shock and/or photoionization. Our results provide new circumstantial evidences for a wandering intermediate-mass black hole in the Galactic center, suggesting also that high-velocity compact clouds can be probes of quiescent black holes that abound in our Galaxy. We report the results of high-resolution molecular line observations of the high-velocity compact cloud HCN─0.085─0.094 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The HCN J = 4─3, HCO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 4─3, and CS J = 7─6 line images reveal that HCN─0.085─0.094 consists mainly of three small clumps with extremely broad velocity widths. Each of the three clumps has a 5.5 GHz radio continuum counterpart in its periphery toward Sgr A*. The positional relationship indicates that their surfaces have been ionized by ultraviolet photons from young stars in the central cluster, suggesting the clumps are in close proximity to the Galactic nucleus. One of the three clumps has a ring-like structure with a very steep velocity gradient. This kinematical structure suggests an orbit around a point-like object with a mass of ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>. The absence of stellar counterparts indicates that the point-like object may be a quiescent black hole. This discovery adds another intermediate-mass black hole candidate in the central region of our Galaxy.",2019,"The central molecular zone of our Galaxy harbors a number of high-velocity compact clouds (HVCCs), which are a peculiar population of spatially compact (d < 10 pc) molecular clouds with extremely broad velocity widths (dV > 50 km/s). We have recently discovered two small (d ~1 pc) HVCCs (sHVCCs) in HCN J=4-3 and J=3-2 maps obtained with the JCMT. Both of these sHVCCs have similar physical properties, emanating from larger dense clouds in the position-velocity spaces. One has a faint counterpart in a Paschen-alpha image. In order to uncover the nature and the origin of these sHVCCs, we propose high-resolution observations in HCN J=4-3 and H26 alpha lines. The possible origin of the sHVCCs is (1) outflow from a deeply embedded massive protostar, (2) supernova explosion in the recent past, (3) cloud-cloud collision, or (4) high-velocity plunge of an invisible massive compact object into a molecular cloud. The ALMA images enable us to discriminate which process has formed the sHVCCs.

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected.

We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2. We report the discovery of molecular gas streams orbiting around an invisible massive object in the central region of our Galaxy, based on the high-resolution molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.

The positional relationship indicates that their surfaces have been ionized by ultraviolet photons from young stars in the central cluster, suggesting the clumps are in close proximity to the Galactic nucleus.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales.

This component is barely resolved at 0.2"" beam and shows significant variations during 4 separate epochs spanning 2 months. In particular, a narrow absorption feature is seen to shift in velocity by about 25 km/s during this period. The motion is consistent with a neutral dense cloud orbiting SgrA*, and could be associated with the G2 cloud infalling towards SgrA*. Because of its high velocity and faint intensity, this feature has never been seen before. In this cycle, we request 4 further epochs of observations to be separated on the order of 2 months again to trace the dynamics.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales.

Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND.

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected.

However, the source of the shocked emission is up for debate. M0.10-0.08 is located near two possible mechanisms for this shock activity: an interaction between an expanding bubble and a gas stream (Butterfield et al. 2018) or a gravitational tidal compression (Kruijssen et al. 2015). The low-resolution of the single-dish observations are unable to determine the morphological structure of the shocked gas. Our proposed ALMA observations will be able to determine the location and kinematics of the shocked emission and determine which mechanism is producing the shocked gas in this cloud.

We report the discovery of molecular gas streams orbiting around an invisible massive object in the central region of our Galaxy, based on the high-resolution molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.

We also found ionized gas toward the inner part of the orbiting gas, indicating dissociative shock and/or photoionization. Our results provide new circumstantial evidences for a wandering intermediate-mass black hole in the Galactic center, suggesting also that high-velocity compact clouds can be probes of quiescent black holes that abound in our Galaxy. We report the results of high-resolution molecular line observations of the high-velocity compact cloud HCN─0.085─0.094 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The HCN J = 4─3, HCO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 4─3, and CS J = 7─6 line images reveal that HCN─0.085─0.094 consists mainly of three small clumps with extremely broad velocity widths. Each of the three clumps has a 5.5 GHz radio continuum counterpart in its periphery toward Sgr A*. The positional relationship indicates that their surfaces have been ionized by ultraviolet photons from young stars in the central cluster, suggesting the clumps are in close proximity to the Galactic nucleus. One of the three clumps has a ring-like structure with a very steep velocity gradient. This kinematical structure suggests an orbit around a point-like object with a mass of ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>. The absence of stellar counterparts indicates that the point-like object may be a quiescent black hole.

In order to uncover the nature and the origin of these sHVCCs, we propose high-resolution observations in HCN J=4-3 and H26 alpha lines. The possible origin of the sHVCCs is (1) outflow from a deeply embedded massive protostar, (2) supernova explosion in the recent past, (3) cloud-cloud collision, or (4) high-velocity plunge of an invisible massive compact object into a molecular cloud.

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2. We report the discovery of molecular gas streams orbiting around an invisible massive object in the central region of our Galaxy, based on the high-resolution molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The morphology and kinematics of these streams can be reproduced well through two Keplerian orbits around a single point mass of (3.2 ± 0.6) × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB>. We also found ionized gas toward the inner part of the orbiting gas, indicating dissociative shock and/or photoionization. Our results provide new circumstantial evidences for a wandering intermediate-mass black hole in the Galactic center, suggesting also that high-velocity compact clouds can be probes of quiescent black holes that abound in our Galaxy. We report the results of high-resolution molecular line observations of the high-velocity compact cloud HCN─0.085─0.094 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The HCN J = 4─3, HCO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 4─3, and CS J = 7─6 line images reveal that HCN─0.085─0.094 consists mainly of three small clumps with extremely broad velocity widths. Each of the three clumps has a 5.5 GHz radio continuum counterpart in its periphery toward Sgr A*. The positional relationship indicates that their surfaces have been ionized by ultraviolet photons from young stars in the central cluster, suggesting the clumps are in close proximity to the Galactic nucleus. One of the three clumps has a ring-like structure with a very steep velocity gradient. This kinematical structure suggests an orbit around a point-like object with a mass of ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>. The absence of stellar counterparts indicates that the point-like object may be a quiescent black hole. This discovery adds another intermediate-mass black hole candidate in the central region of our Galaxy.",2019,"The central molecular zone of our Galaxy harbors a number of high-velocity compact clouds (HVCCs), which are a peculiar population of spatially compact (d < 10 pc) molecular clouds with extremely broad velocity widths (dV > 50 km/s). We have recently discovered two small (d ~1 pc) HVCCs (sHVCCs) in HCN J=4-3 and J=3-2 maps obtained with the JCMT. Both of these sHVCCs have similar physical properties, emanating from larger dense clouds in the position-velocity spaces. One has a faint counterpart in a Paschen-alpha image. In order to uncover the nature and the origin of these sHVCCs, we propose high-resolution observations in HCN J=4-3 and H26 alpha lines. The possible origin of the sHVCCs is (1) outflow from a deeply embedded massive protostar, (2) supernova explosion in the recent past, (3) cloud-cloud collision, or (4) high-velocity plunge of an invisible massive compact object into a molecular cloud. The ALMA images enable us to discriminate which process has formed the sHVCCs.

Our Galactic center provides a unique opportunity to study shocked gas in molecular clouds at sub-parsec scales. We propose to study a compact molecular cloud, M0.10-0.08, which has elevated emission in several 3 mm shock tracers (e.g., SiO, HCN) in single-dish observations (Mills & Battersby 2017). However, the source of the shocked emission is up for debate. M0.10-0.08 is located near two possible mechanisms for this shock activity: an interaction between an expanding bubble and a gas stream (Butterfield et al. 2018) or a gravitational tidal compression (Kruijssen et al. 2015). The low-resolution of the single-dish observations are unable to determine the morphological structure of the shocked gas. Our proposed ALMA observations will be able to determine the location and kinematics of the shocked emission and determine which mechanism is producing the shocked gas in this cloud.

Our Galactic center provides a unique opportunity to study shocked gas in molecular clouds at sub-parsec scales. We propose to study a compact molecular cloud, M0.10-0.08, which has elevated emission in several 3 mm shock tracers (e.g., SiO, HCN) in single-dish observations (Mills & Battersby 2017). However, the source of the shocked emission is up for debate. M0.10-0.08 is located near two possible mechanisms for this shock activity: an interaction between an expanding bubble and a gas stream (Butterfield et al. 2018) or a gravitational tidal compression (Kruijssen et al. 2015). The low-resolution of the single-dish observations are unable to determine the morphological structure of the shocked gas. Our proposed ALMA observations will be able to determine the location and kinematics of the shocked emission and determine which mechanism is producing the shocked gas in this cloud.

However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"Measures of gas excitation in Galactic center molecular clouds are lacking on sub-parsec scales. Without these measurements, we lack constraints on the density structure of clouds necessary to test models of star formation in this environment and determine why so many clouds are not forming stars. We also lack a knowledge of the chemical abundance structure necessary to determine the impact of factors like shocks and cosmic rays and how they set the initial chemical conditions for star formation here. We propose to make the first survey of sub-parsec scale gas excitation in the Galactic center by observing a representative sample of clouds in Band 7 with ACA (resolution 3.5) and leveraging existing Band 3 ALMA 12m and Band 6 SMA coverage of these clouds. With 100 mK sensitivity we will detect lines of more than a dozen species, most of which are also mapped at another frequency. This will enable the first measurements of density structure and molecular abundances on sub-parsec scales and build a unique legacy dataset for future study.",50_kms_a_07_7M,"Kauffmann, Jens; Schmiedeke, Anika; Battersby, Cara; Riquelme, Denise; Moser, Lydia; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Martin, Sergio; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Corby, Joanna; Higuchi, Aya; Pillai, Thushara; Ginsburg, Adam;",140.99199510230125,4.675391396627944,0.9100000262260437,uid://A001/X12a3/X100,uid://A001/X12a3/X101,uid://A002/Xd23397/X7e25,Sub-parsec Gas Excitation in the Galactic Center,S,TARGET,T,21.052879867873877,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N606:CM06,T,2020-01-03T16:14:05.000,3.3022445964325606,"[342.24..344.24GHz,1128.91kHz,119.5mJy/beam@10km/s,9mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [344.00..346.00GHz,1128.91kHz,110.7mJy/beam@10km/s,8.4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [354.04..356.04GHz,1128.91kHz,124.5mJy/beam@10km/s,9.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [355.99..357.99GHz,1128.91kHz,141mJy/beam@10km/s,10.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",356.9878759775914,950.7591114662382,"Mills, Elisabeth",ALMACAL - VI.

Ortiz-León, Gisela N.; Menten, Karl M.; Kamiński, Tomasz; Brunthaler, Andreas; Reid, Mark J.; Tylenda, Romuald","Context. V838 Mon erupted in 2002, quickly becoming the prototype of a new type of stellar eruption known today as the (luminous) red nova. Red nova outbursts are thought to be caused by stellar mergers. The merger in V838 Mon took place in a triple or higher system involving two B-type stars. <BR /> Aims: We wish to characterize the merger remnant ~17 yr after the eruption to learn more about the remaining system, the progenitor, and the merger physics. <BR /> Methods: We mapped the merger site with ALMA at a resolution of ~25 mas, or 148 au for a distance of 5.9 kpc, in continuum dust emission and in rotational lines of simple molecules, including CO, SiO, SO, SO<SUB>2</SUB>, AlOH, and H<SUB>2</SUB>S. We use radiative transfer calculations to reproduce the architecture of the remnant at the epoch of the ALMA observations. We also make use of optical spectroscopy data obtained mainly with VLT/X-shooter and SALT/HRS. <BR /> Results: For the first time, we identify the position of the B-type companion relative to the outbursting component of V838 Mon. The stellar remnant is surrounded by a clumpy wind with characteristics similar to those of the winds of red supergiants. The merger product is also associated with an elongated structure of 17.6 × 7.6 mas (104 × 45 au) seen in continuum emission, and which we interpret as a disk seen at a moderate inclination. Maps of continuum and molecular emission also show a complex region of interaction between the B-type star (its gravity, radiation, and wind) and the flow of matter ejected in 2002. The remnant's molecular mass is about 0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and the dust mass is 8.3 × 10<SUP>−3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The mass of the atomic component remains unconstrained. <BR /> Conclusions: The most interesting region for understanding the merger of V838 Mon lies in its direct vicinity and appears elongated, but details of its substructure remain unknown. To study it further and in more detail will require even higher angular resolutions. ALMA maps show us an extreme form of interaction between the merger ejecta and the distant (~250 au) companion. This interaction is similar to that known from the Anteres AB system but at a much higher mass loss rate. The B-type star not only deflects the merger ejecta but also changes its molecular composition with an involvement of circumstellar shocks. The ALMA view of V838 Mon offers the best images of a merger site so far. <P />Movies associated with Figs. 9 and 12 are available at <A href=""https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202141526/olm"">https://www.aanda.org</A> We present multiepoch observations with the Very Long Baseline Array of SiO maser emission in the v = 1, J = 1-0 transition at 43 GHz from the remnant of the red nova V838 Mon. We modeled the positions of maser spots to derive a parallax of 0.166 ± 0.060 mas. Combining this parallax with other distance information results in a distance of 5.6 ± 0.5 kpc, which is in agreement with an independent geometric distance of 6.1 ± 0.6 kpc from modeling polarimetry images of V838 Mon's light echo. Combining these results, and including a weakly constraining Gaia parallax, yields a best estimate of distance of 5.9 ± 0.4 kpc. The maser spots are located close to the peaks of continuum at ∼225 GHz and SiO J = 5-4 thermal emission detected with the Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array. The proper motion of V838 Mon confirms its membership in a small open cluster in the Outer spiral arm of the Milky Way. <P />Fits images associated with Figs. 2-4 are only available at CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (<A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://130.79.128.5</A>) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/638/A17"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/638/A17</A>",2020,"Red novae erupt in stellar collisions which we can observe in real time. Although rare, they give us a chance to investigate the physics of the most extreme form of binary interaction. Using ALMA and SMA, we recently found that cool remnants of red novae are sources of rich molecular emission at submillimeter wavelengths. The molecular gas traces material that was dispersed in the merger event. We propose to use ALMA to spatially resolve molecular emission in two red nova remnants, V1309 Sco and V838 Mon, and reproduce their 3-dimensional spatio-kinematic structure. With a clear view on the two merger sites, we aim (1) to decode the geometry of the merged systems, (2) measure the energy of the merger eruption, and (3) follow the angular momentum transfer that had driven the spiraling-in and the coalescence of the binaries.

We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and astrochemistry. ...(9)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law.

The high-mass star-forming clump G286.21+0.17 (G286 for short) that contains an 'L' type filament was thought to undergo global collapse. Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and astrochemistry. ...(9)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions.

(3) investigate how globally collapse and stellar feedback influence CFE and the distributions of dense gas in proto-clusters.",I17439-2_a_03_TM1,"Bronfman, Leonardo; Yi, Hee-Weon; Juvela, Mika; Goldsmith, Paul; Garay, Guido; Wu, Yuefang; Qin, Sheng-Li; Tej, Anandmayee; Hirota, Tomoya; Kim, Kee-Tae; Yun, Hyeong-Sik; Zhang, Qizhou; Cunningham, Maria; Mardones, Diego; Kang, Sung-ju; Evans, Neal; Wu, Jingwen; Li, Pak Shing; Lee, Jeong-Eun; Wang, Ke; Toth, Laszlo Viktor; Ristorcelli, Isabelle; Liu, Sheng-Yuan; Tatematsu, Ken'ichi;",1.504241806643686,0.04161893101105735,0.630641758441925,uid://A001/X1465/X288a,uid://A001/X1465/X288b,uid://A002/Xe2ada9/Xf64,On the origin of the dense gas star formation law in Galactic high-mass star forming clumps,S,TARGET,T,16.79358021245167,58593750.0,A001:DA48 A002:DA44 A005:DV22 A006:DV13 A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A024:DA58 A025:DV10 A027:DV17 A033:DA49 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A036:DA64 A040:DA65 A041:DV03 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA59 A072:DA53 A073:DV23 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A091:DA61 A094:DV14 T703:PM01,F,2021-03-31T01:53:23.000,1.309273430413568,"[86.31..86.36GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.72..86.78GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.81..86.87GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.27..87.33GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.60..88.66GHz,61.04kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [89.15..89.21GHz,61.04kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.53..99.40GHz,976.56kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,60uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.46..101.34GHz,976.56kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,63.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",89.18321767222426,205.1133080194908,"Liu, Tie",ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions - I.

Through examining the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of this emission, we identify molecular structures that may trace jet-driven cavities in the gas surrounding these systems. Our results from the GRS 1758-258 region in particular, are consistent with recent work, which postulated the presence of a jet-blown cocoon structure in deep radio continuum maps of the region. Using these newly discovered molecular structures as calorimeters, we estimate the time averaged jet power from these systems, finding $(1.1{\!-\!}5.7)\times 10^{36}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.12-0.31 Myr for GRS 1758-258 and $(0.7{\!-\!}3.5)\times 10^{37}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.10-0.26 Myr for 1E 1740.7-2942. Additionally, the spectral line characteristics of the detected emission place these molecular structures in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy, thereby constraining the distances to the black hole X-ray binaries to be 8.0 ± 1.0 kpc. Overall, our analysis solidifies the diagnostic capacity of molecular lines, and highlights how astro-chemistry can both identify jet-ISM interaction zones and probe jet feedback from Galactic X-ray binaries.",2020,"Relativistic jets launched from accreting black holes carry large amounts of energy and matter into their environment. Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), the stellar-mass analogues of active galactic nuclei, are ideal targets for studying the interactions between the jet and the ambient ISM in detail, due to their close proximity and the rapid timescale evolution of BHXB jets. Identifying and probing the ISM properties in interaction zones provides insight into highly sought-after jet properties, such as the jet power, composition, duty cycles, and the efficiency of jet feedback. As molecular lines are excellent diagnostics of shock energetics and ISM excitation, our team recently obtained ALMA ACA observations of the candidate interaction sites around the BHXBs GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942, identifying several intriguing compact regions of bright molecular emission. Here we propose follow-up, high resolution ALMA 12m array observations of these fields (total time of 2.3 hours). With these data we will build on our first results to test whether these zones are consistent with being powered by a BHXB jet, and estimate the energy input into the ISM from these BHXB jets.",1E1740.7_b_03_TM1,"Miller-Jones, James; Rosolowsky, Erik; Sivakoff, Gregory;",2.1462450298783358,0.06766928554262325,2.9303433895111084,uid://A001/X1469/X284,uid://A001/X1469/X285,uid://A002/Xe407cf/X6f2b,Mapping Jet-ISM Interactions in X-ray Binaries,S,TARGET,T,25.911184425003295,234375000.0,A001:DA48 A002:DA44 A004:DA56 A006:DV13 A007:DV21 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A013:DV11 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A017:DV14 A019:DA61 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A024:DA58 A025:DV10 A027:DV17 A028:DA59 A030:DA52 A031:DA62 A033:DA49 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A036:DA64 A038:DA60 A039:DV16 A041:DV03 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A046:DA51 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A072:DA53 A074:DV09,T,2021-03-17T16:33:42.000,2.6741050494919216,"[86.73..86.96GHz,282.23kHz,2.3mJy/beam@10km/s,252.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.81..88.04GHz,282.23kHz,2.3mJy/beam@10km/s,252.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.51..88.75GHz,282.23kHz,2.2mJy/beam@10km/s,241.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [89.07..89.31GHz,282.23kHz,2.1mJy/beam@10km/s,241.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.75..98.22GHz,282.23kHz,2.1mJy/beam@10km/s,171.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.00..100.99GHz,31250.00kHz,2.2mJy/beam@10km/s,91.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",89.18838855830998,865.6065630629148,"Tetarenko, Alexandra",Jet-ISM interactions near the microquasars GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942,"Tetarenko, A.

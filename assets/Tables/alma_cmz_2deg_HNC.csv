Xue, Ci; Remijan, Anthony J.; Burkhardt, Andrew M.; Herbst, Eric","Aminoacetonitrile (NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) was detected in the interstellar medium (ISM) one decade ago in the course of a spectral survey of the hot molecular core Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) with the IRAM 30 m telescope. With the advent of sensitive telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the degree of chemical complexity in the ISM can be further explored. In the family of aminoacetonitrile, the next stage in complexity with one additional CH<SUB>2</SUB> group is aminopropionitrile. This molecule has two structural isomers, a chain-like (3-aminopropionitrile, NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) and a branched, chiral one (2-aminopropionitrile, CH<SUB>3</SUB>CH(NH<SUB>2</SUB>) CN). The latter was studied in the laboratory a few years ago and was not detected in the IRAM 30 m survey. We present the search for both isomers in the EMoCA (Exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA) survey, a sensitive spectral survey of Sgr B2(N) performed with ALMA. The rotational spectrum of 3-aminopropionitrile has been recorded in laboratory with a submillimeter spectrometer using solid-state sources. Helped by ab initio calculations performed for the different possible conformations, we present here the analysis based on a Watson Hamiltonian for an asymmetric one-top rotor in A-reduction performed in the frequency range 150-500 GHz for two conformers. More than 6200 lines of the ground-state and lowest excited vibrational states, corresponding to more than 8200 transitions, were assigned in the experimental spectrum. Partition functions, including the vibrational contribution of these states, and predictions in the JPL-CDMS catalog format were determined in order to search for both conformers of 3-aminopropionitrile in Sgr B2(N). Neither 3-aminopropionitrile, nor 2-aminopropionitrile are detected. The derived upper limits imply that they are at least 12 and 5 times less abundant than aminoacetonitrile, respectively. A comparison to ethyl cyanide and n-propyl cyanide detected in this source suggests that an improvement by a factor three in sensitivity may be sufficient to detect 3-aminopropionitrile, which should be within the range of our on-going follow-up project with ALMA. ...(20)",2014,"The search for complex pre-biotic and biotic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) will be a primary focus of ALMA science. The molecular inventory of meteorites found on Earth includes more than 80 distinct amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), and their composition suggests an interstellar origin. The key search site for new complex organics in the ISM is the hot dense core Sgr B2(N), due partly to its high column density. However, the firm identification of new molecules requires a robust spectral model to unweave the emission lines of weakly-emitting, more complex, species from known molecules. We have already constructed a unique model of this kind, using our previous single-dish line survey, which has already allowed our team to uncover several new species. We propose to use ALMA Early Science to perform a deep, unbiased line survey of Sgr B2(N) in band 3 (8 hours observing time). The proposed survey will improve the detection threshold for complex organic molecules by nearly a factor of 20 compared to our previous survey of this source. Such a sensitivity improvement should lead to the firm detection of a few, perhaps a dozen, new complex organics, while the adaptation of our existing spectral model will allow a rapid turn-around from detection to publication. The use of our team's cutting edge chemical models will allow the broader implications of new discoveries to be understood, and place strong constraints on chemical formation pathways. The discovery of biologically-relevant molecules in the ISM will be of high scientific impact, and is of broad appeal to the public and the media. The combination of ALMA's unique spectral sensitivity with our established methodologies will provide an efficient showcase of ALMA's capabilities in this field.",SgrB2_T2_B3_extended,"Garrod, Robin; Müller, Holger; Menten, Karl;",1.6902809800813954,0.033978623113527825,0.6536063551902771,,uid://A002/X327408/X10,uid://A002/X41f8d2/X8e0,Expanding the frontiers of chemical complexity with ALMA,S,TARGET,T,17.836934238229638,1875000000.0,A003:DA41 A004:DV04 A008:DV19 A011:DV12 A021:DV08 A025:DV14 A045:DV11 A046:DV09 A050:DA42 A053:DV18 A067:DA46 A068:DA44 A069:DV16 A070:DA45 A071:DV10 A072:DV13 A074:DV15 A075:DA43 A076:PM03 A077:DV02 A082:DV05 A137:DV03 A138:DV17 T702:PM02 T704:PM01,F,2014-09-12T00:00:00.000,1.4864660617677599,"[87.72..89.60GHz,488.28kHz,1.7mJy/beam@10km/s,68uJy/beam@native, XX] U [89.54..91.42GHz,488.28kHz,1.7mJy/beam@10km/s,67.8uJy/beam@native, XX] U [99.72..101.59GHz,488.28kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,67.7uJy/beam@native, XX] U [101.54..103.42GHz,488.28kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,68.3uJy/beam@native, XX]",90.48276237028071,1415.4160834929535,"Belloche, Arnaud",ALMA Observations of the Spatial Distribution of Three C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> Isomers toward Sgr B2(N) Complex organic molecules in diffuse clouds along the line of sight to Sagittarius B2 Detection of a branched alkyl molecule in the inte,"Ando, Ryo Belloche, A.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_7M,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",86.97432434467754,1.7264628290144566,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X121/X4bc,uid://A002/X85b7b2/Xb3,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,TARGET,T,90.12415312315139,1992187500.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J506:CM05 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2015-08-29T01:53:46.000,12.868083618201824,"[88.48..90.47GHz,488.28kHz,87.8mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.29..92.28GHz,488.28kHz,87mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.37..102.36GHz,488.28kHz,82.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.23..104.22GHz,488.28kHz,87.1mJy/beam@10km/s,3.6mJy/beam@native, XX]",91.28225599645145,1404.5227716097966,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_TC,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",14.031060141233805,0.28517373917287614,4.546826362609863,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X121/X4ba,uid://A002/X95e355/X1f13,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,TARGET,T,28.860732445758064,1875000000.0,A001:DA58 A002:DV16 A003:DV21 A004:DV24 A005:DV25 A006:DA42 A011:DV22 A013:DA51 A015:DV18 A016:DV04 A017:DA57 A018:DA63 A019:DA54 A021:DA59 A023:DV11 A024:DV10 A026:DV09 A027:DV13 A029:DA49 A030:DA45 A031:DV08 A033:DV19 A034:DV20 A035:DA52 A036:DA60 A037:DV12 A038:DV07 A040:DA43 A042:DV17 A043:DA48 A044:DV15 A046:DA62 A050:DV14 A058:DA46 A060:DA55 A062:DV05 A066:DA64 A068:DA44 A069:DA53 A070:DA47 A071:DA50 A072:DV01 A075:DA61 A137:DA41 T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,T,2016-06-07T02:44:17.000,2.1144830360503604,"[88.54..90.42GHz,488.28kHz,14.2mJy/beam@10km/s,565.2uJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.34..92.22GHz,488.28kHz,14mJy/beam@10km/s,565.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.43..102.30GHz,488.28kHz,13.4mJy/beam@10km/s,568.2uJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.29..104.16GHz,488.28kHz,13.6mJy/beam@10km/s,583.1uJy/beam@native, XX]",91.28249453841276,1405.1483871501034,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_TC,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",3.3722899453874264,0.06851741707258369,2.9773616790771484,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X121/X4ba,uid://A002/X9cffbd/Xefe,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,PHASE WVR,F,24.364476966197678,1875000000.0,A001:DA58 A003:DV21 A004:DV24 A005:DV25 A011:DV22 A013:DA51 A015:DV18 A017:DA57 A018:DA63 A019:DA54 A021:DA59 A023:DV11 A024:DV10 A026:DV09 A027:DV13 A029:DA49 A030:DA45 A031:DV08 A033:DV19 A034:DV20 A035:DA52 A036:DA60 A037:DV12 A038:DV07 A042:DV17 A043:DA48 A046:DA62 A058:DA46 A062:DV05 A066:DA64 A068:DA44 A069:DA53 A070:DA47 A071:DA50 A072:DV01 A075:DA61 A137:DA41 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,F,2016-06-07T02:44:17.000,2.247382573638136,"[88.54..90.42GHz,488.28kHz,3.4mJy/beam@10km/s,135.8uJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.35..92.22GHz,488.28kHz,3.4mJy/beam@10km/s,135.9uJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.43..102.30GHz,488.28kHz,3.2mJy/beam@10km/s,136.2uJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.29..104.16GHz,488.28kHz,3.3mJy/beam@10km/s,140.4uJy/beam@native, XX]",91.28295821332324,1405.1483871501034,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

Depending upon the mass of this gas reservoir, the fate of the CND (whether it will it form stars, or eventually accrete on the black hole) will have a substantial impact on the evolution of the central parsec of our Galaxy. Its fate depends upon its density: gas clumps with densities > 10^7 cm^-3 are stable, and can collapse and form stars, whereas unstable clumps should quickly be sheared apart and eventually accrete onto the black hole. We propose to use the resolution and sensitivity of Cycle 2 ALMA to conduct a robust probe of gas density on the scales of individual clumps (1"", or 0.04 pc) via simultaneous excitation analyses of multiple tracers and the inclusion of radiative excitation.

Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

P.; Bergin, E.; Comito, C.; Möller, Th.","Context. Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center. In spite of their similar mass and luminosity, they are very different, both morphologically (M is very fragmented, N almost monolithic) and in their chemical appearence - while M is line poor, except for rich spectra of sulphur-bearing molecules, N is very line rich, and has yielded many new complex organic molecules.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_TE,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",10.468670583119325,0.21287935317739626,3.1221659183502197,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X121/X4b8,uid://A002/Xa4ce71/X49f,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,TARGET,T,5.185669075125325,1875000000.0,A011:DV04 A015:DV18 A021:DA59 A029:DA49 A033:DV19 A058:DA46 A060:DA55 A064:DA50 A069:DA53 A072:DV01 A073:DA63 A075:DA61 A076:DV13 A077:DV16 A078:DV15 A079:DA43 A080:DV24 A082:DA42 A083:DV25 A084:DV05 A085:DA51 A086:DV14 A087:DV23 A088:DV20 A089:DA60 A090:DA54 A091:DA58 A093:DV21 A094:DV02 A096:DV10 A097:DA62 A101:DA47 A103:DV03 A104:DA44 A105:DA52 A107:DA64 A110:DV22 A112:DV07 A113:DA57 A115:DV11 A135:DA45 A136:DV17 A137:DA41,T,2017-11-05T00:00:00.000,0.46087520154734973,"[88.54..90.42GHz,488.28kHz,10.6mJy/beam@10km/s,421.7uJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.34..92.22GHz,488.28kHz,10.5mJy/beam@10km/s,421.9uJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.43..102.30GHz,488.28kHz,10mJy/beam@10km/s,422.8uJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.29..104.16GHz,488.28kHz,10.2mJy/beam@10km/s,437.3uJy/beam@native, XX]",91.28226151527183,1405.3113217795521,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

Understanding the formation and evolution of these clouds is critical for many fields in astronomy, such as star formation under extreme conditions and clouds in starbursts and the early universe. The CMZ gas is organized in a roughly edge-on ring of ~100 pc radius. The near-side, as seen from Earth, contains ALL of the dense and massive CMZ clouds, while the gas on the far-side is rather unstructured. It has been suggested that this is due to the gravitational influence of Sgr A*, which is closer to the near-side. Here we explore why the far-side does not host ANY significant cloud. Are there clouds at all, or does the far-side essentially represent an unstructured turbulent flow? If there are clouds, how ""old"" are they, based on their dynamical state?

Understanding the formation and evolution of these clouds is critical for many fields in astronomy, such as star formation under extreme conditions and clouds in starbursts and the early universe. The CMZ gas is organized in a roughly edge-on ring of ~100 pc radius. The near-side, as seen from Earth, contains ALL of the dense and massive CMZ clouds, while the gas on the far-side is rather unstructured. It has been suggested that this is due to the gravitational influence of Sgr A*, which is closer to the near-side. Here we explore why the far-side does not host ANY significant cloud. Are there clouds at all, or does the far-side essentially represent an unstructured turbulent flow? If there are clouds, how ""old"" are they, based on their dynamical state?

Gerin, M.; Liszt, H.; Neufeld, D.; Godard, B.; Sonnentrucker, P.; Pety, J.; Roueff, E.","<BR /> Aims: The transition between atomic and molecular hydrogen is associated with important changes in the structure of interstellar clouds, and marks the beginning of interstellar chemistry. Most molecular ions are rapidly formed (in ion-molecule reactions) and destroyed (by dissociative recombination) in the diffuse ISM. Because of the relatively simple networks controlling their abundances, molecular ions are usually good probes of the underlying physical conditions including, for instance the fraction of gas in molecular form or the fractional ionization. In this paper we focus on three possible probes of the molecular hydrogen column density, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP>. <BR /> Methods: We presented high-sensitivity ALMA absorption data toward a sample of compact H II regions and bright QSOs with prominent foreground absorption, in the ground-state transitions of the molecular ions HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> and the neutral species HCN and HNC, and from the excited-state transitions of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(4-3) and <SUP>13</SUP>CS(2-1). These data are compared with Herschel absorption spectra of the ground-state transition of HF and p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O. <BR /> Results: We show that the HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> column densities are well correlated with each other. HCO<SUP>+</SUP> and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> are tightly correlated with p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O, while they exhibit a different correlation pattern with HF depending on whether the absorbing matter is located in the Galactic disk or in the central molecular zone. We report new detections of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> confirming that this ion is ubiquitous in the diffuse matter, with an abundance relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> of 7 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: We confirm that the CF<SUP>+</SUP> abundance is lower than predicted by simple chemical models and propose that the rate of the main formation reaction is lower by a factor of about 3 than usually assumed. In the absence of CH or HF data, we recommend to use the ground-state transitions of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, CCH, and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> to trace diffuse molecular hydrogen, with mean abundances relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> of 3 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>, 4 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP>, and 4 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>, respectively, leading to sensitivity N(H<SUB>2</SUB>)/ ∫ τdv of 4 × 10<SUP>20</SUP>, 1.5 × 10<SUP>21</SUP>, and 6 × 10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> /km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. The continuum divided spectra are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/622/A26"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/622/A26</A> ...(1)",2017,"Herschel and Planck data confirm the presence of diffuse ISM gas that is not well traced by the usual atomic or molecular probes, ie H I or CO. It can be followed in C+, in emission at 1.9 THz, but we propose a more accessible probe of C+ by following gas-phase fluorine into HF and CF+. When H2 is present, fluorine concentrates into HF exothermically via F+H2->HF+H and forms CF+ via C+ + HF->CF+ + H, making CF+ the 2nd largest fluorine reservoir where C+ and H2 coexist. Since HF tracks H2, CF+ is a perfect tracer of the H I-> H2 transition. Recent observations toward the Horsehead and the bright QSOs BLLAC and 3C111 illustrate this in the science case. We propose to use ALMA to perform an exploratory survey of CF+ absorption in the inner galactic plane using well characterized sight-lines towards continuum sources studied in the Herschel PRISMAS survey and other means.

Most molecular ions are rapidly formed (in ion-molecule reactions) and destroyed (by dissociative recombination) in the diffuse ISM. Because of the relatively simple networks controlling their abundances, molecular ions are usually good probes of the underlying physical conditions including, for instance the fraction of gas in molecular form or the fractional ionization. In this paper we focus on three possible probes of the molecular hydrogen column density, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP>. <BR /> Methods: We presented high-sensitivity ALMA absorption data toward a sample of compact H II regions and bright QSOs with prominent foreground absorption, in the ground-state transitions of the molecular ions HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> and the neutral species HCN and HNC, and from the excited-state transitions of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(4-3) and <SUP>13</SUP>CS(2-1). These data are compared with Herschel absorption spectra of the ground-state transition of HF and p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O. <BR /> Results: We show that the HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> column densities are well correlated with each other. HCO<SUP>+</SUP> and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> are tightly correlated with p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O, while they exhibit a different correlation pattern with HF depending on whether the absorbing matter is located in the Galactic disk or in the central molecular zone. We report new detections of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> confirming that this ion is ubiquitous in the diffuse matter, with an abundance relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> of 7 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: We confirm that the CF<SUP>+</SUP> abundance is lower than predicted by simple chemical models and propose that the rate of the main formation reaction is lower by a factor of about 3 than usually assumed. In the absence of CH or HF data, we recommend to use the ground-state transitions of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, CCH, and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> to trace diffuse molecular hydrogen, with mean abundances relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> of 3 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>, 4 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP>, and 4 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>, respectively, leading to sensitivity N(H<SUB>2</SUB>)/ ∫ τdv of 4 × 10<SUP>20</SUP>, 1.5 × 10<SUP>21</SUP>, and 6 × 10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> /km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_TP,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",26.193806550455797,0.5194349368710425,4.389588832855225,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X147/X92,uid://A002/X9a755e/X1f06,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,TARGET WVR,T,966.9477008976131,1992187500.0,A072:DV01 T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,F,2017-01-13T21:39:57.000,54.55125132267276,"[88.48..90.47GHz,488.28kHz,28mJy/beam@10km/s,1.1mJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.29..92.28GHz,488.28kHz,26.2mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.37..102.36GHz,488.28kHz,24.9mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.23..104.22GHz,488.28kHz,24.7mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX]",91.28268763639178,1404.3678052678852,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

Our main goals are to quantify the time variations of the total intensity, polarization percentage, apparent/intrinsic polarization position angles, and the Faraday rotation measure, on timescales of from a few integration time to hourly timescales. We emphasize that the proposed observing frequencies are the highest possible for the full polarization ALMA observations, which will trace the relativistic accretion flow from the optically thin part of the synchrotron spectrum. Diagnosing the correlations between the time variations of the quantities we measure, will clarify fundamentional properties of the relativistic flows immediately surrouding the event horizon, such as whether some emission is coming from flares, and whether or not the magnetic field configuration is steady during the flares. The observations of rotation measure will constrain the present accretion rate of Sgr A*, and the time variability of the accretion rate.",SgrA_sta_a_07_TM1,"Ho, Paul; Mills, Elisabeth; Martin, Sergio; Zhao, Jun-Hui; Falcke, Heino; Brinkerink, Christiaan; Matsushita, Satoki; wright, melvyn;",1.1665540256557816,0.04313537283407434,0.9367678165435791,uid://A001/X879/X992,uid://A001/X879/X993,uid://A002/Xc20718/X515d,Hairs of the Circum-Event-Horizon Gas Streams?,S,TARGET,T,4.150051224732952,1875000000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A009:DV18 A015:DA61 A064:DA42 A067:DV12 A068:DV13 A069:DA55 A070:DA48 A071:DA52 A073:DV22 A074:DA47 A075:DV11 A076:DV17 A078:DV08 A079:DA54 A081:DA43 A084:DV04 A085:DA56 A086:DV01 A087:DV25 A089:DV06 A091:DA45 A092:DV14 A093:DV20 A094:DV19 A095:DV10 A096:DV09 A097:DA60 A098:DV05 A099:DA63 A100:DA65 A101:DA62 A102:DV03 A103:DV16 A104:DA58 A111:PM02 A129:DA46 A132:DV23 A134:DA44 A135:DA57,F,2018-09-06T17:14:21.000,0.13099253340147005,"[347.21..349.09GHz,1953.12kHz,1.1mJy/beam@10km/s,87.9uJy/beam@native, XX XY YX YY] U [349.07..350.94GHz,1953.12kHz,1mJy/beam@10km/s,82.1uJy/beam@native, XX XY YX YY] U [359.21..361.09GHz,1953.12kHz,1mJy/beam@10km/s,82.8uJy/beam@native, XX XY YX YY] U [361.07..362.94GHz,1953.12kHz,1.2mJy/beam@10km/s,93.6uJy/beam@native, XX XY YX YY]",362.00255681169654,1621.5062653124155,"Liu, Hauyu Baobab",,,T,,"Outflows, jets, feedback, Galactic centres/nuclei",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,HNC (4-3)

Aminoacetonitrile, a molecule detected in the interstellar medium only toward the star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), is considered an important prebiotic species; in particular, it is a possible precursor of the simplest amino acid glycine. To date, observations have been limited to ground state emission lines, whereas transitions from within vibrationally excited states remained undetected. <BR /> Aims: We wanted to accurately determine the energies of the low-lying vibrational states of aminoacetonitrile, which are expected to be populated in Sgr B2(N1), the main hot core of Sgr B2(N). This step is fundamental in order to properly evaluate the vibration-rotation partition function of aminoacetonitrile as well as the line strengths of the rotational transitions of its vibrationally excited states. This is necessary to derive accurate column densities and secure the identification of these transitions in astronomical spectra. <BR /> Methods: The far-infrared ro-vibrational spectrum of aminoacetonitrile has been recorded in absorption against a synchrotron source of continuum emission. Three bands, corresponding to the lowest vibrational modes of aminoacetonitrile, were observed in the frequency region below 500 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The combined analysis of ro-vibrational and pure rotational data allowed us to prepare new spectral line catalogs for all the states under investigation. We used the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA performed with ALMA to search for vibrationally excited aminoacetonitrile toward Sgr B2(N1). The astronomical spectra were analyzed under the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation. <BR /> Results: Almost 11 000 lines have been assigned during the analysis of the laboratory spectrum of aminoacetonitrile, thanks to which the vibrational energies of the v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1, v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1, and v<SUB>17</SUB> = 1 states have been determined. The whole dataset, which includes high J and K<SUB>a</SUB> transitions, is well reproduced within the experimental accuracy. Reliable spectral predictions of pure rotational lines can now be produced up to the THz region. On the basis of these spectroscopic predictions, we report the interstellar detection of aminoacetonitrile in its v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 vibrational states toward Sgr B2(N1) in addition to emission from its vibrational ground state. The intensities of the identified v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 lines are consistent with the detected v = 0 lines under LTE at a temperature of 200 K for an aminoacetonitrile column density of 1.1 × 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: This work shows the strong interplay between laboratory spectroscopy exploiting (sub)millimeter and synchrotron-based far-infrared techniques, and observational spectral surveys to detect complex organic molecules in space and quantify their abundances. <P />The list of assigned transitions is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160</A> ...(6)",2019,"ALMA has had a transformational effect on the search for complex organic molecules (COMs) in star-forming regions, pushing the limits of observable chemical complexity. Our recent detection of a branched alkyl molecule in the interstellar medium (ISM) with ALMA has opened a new domain in the structures available to the chemistry of star-forming regions, beyond simple chains. Our astrochemical model was recently expanded to include branched isomers, and indicates that branched molecules may be dominant in star-forming regions where the chemistry is of sufficient complexity. We propose to perform a direct observational test of this hypothesis, in order to determine both the degree and the manner in which chemical complexity evolves during star formation. We propose to search for n-butyl cyanide and its three branched isomers toward Sgr B2(N), the most fruitful target for new detections of COMs in the ISM. The discovery of biologically-relevant molecules in the ISM is of high scientific impact. The combination of our established and productive methodologies with ALMA's unique spectral sensitivity is an ideal match to delve into the newly-discovered chemistry of branched COMs.",SgrB2-N_b_03_TM1,"Garrod, Robin; Müller, Holger; Menten, Karl;",0.7159601713477656,0.014434150729975505,2.093872547149658,uid://A001/X87a/X5df,uid://A001/X87a/X5e0,uid://A002/Xba2b1d/X931,Do branched molecules dominate in the ISM?,S,TARGET,T,7.688836296290654,1875000000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A006:DV15 A009:DV18 A010:DV23 A015:DA61 A023:DA51 A027:DA56 A034:DA46 A060:DV06 A061:DA44 A064:DV13 A065:DA64 A065:DV01 A066:DV21 A067:DV12 A068:DV08 A068:DV13 A069:DA55 A070:DA48 A070:DV12 A071:DA48 A071:DA52 A072:DA43 A072:DA53 A073:DA42 A073:DV22 A074:DA47 A074:DV09 A075:DV11 A075:DV24 A076:DA54 A076:DV17 A077:DA52 A077:DV24 A078:DV05 A078:DV08 A079:DA54 A079:DA64 A080:DA50 A081:DA53 A084:DV04 A084:DV07 A085:DA47 A085:DA56 A086:DV01 A086:DV11 A087:DV10 A087:DV25 A088:DA57 A088:DV07 A089:DV06 A090:DV24 A091:DA45 A091:DA63 A092:DV14 A092:DV17 A093:DV20 A094:DV19 A095:DV10 A095:DV25 A096:DA65 A096:DV09 A097:DA60 A097:DV03 ,F,2018-12-09T00:00:00.000,0.5197480239466615,"[87.73..89.62GHz,488.28kHz,723uJy/beam@10km/s,28.7uJy/beam@native, XX] U [89.56..91.45GHz,488.28kHz,716uJy/beam@10km/s,28.7uJy/beam@native, XX] U [99.73..101.62GHz,488.28kHz,675.6uJy/beam@10km/s,28.6uJy/beam@native, XX] U [101.56..103.45GHz,488.28kHz,689.8uJy/beam@10km/s,29.5uJy/beam@native, XX]",90.50225803299347,1441.2366411609928,"Belloche, Arnaud",Far-infrared laboratory spectroscopy of aminoacetonitrile and first interstellar detection of its vibrationally excited transitions Laboratory rotational spectroscopy of acrylamide and a search for acrylamide and propionamide toward Sgr B2(N) with ALMA Mil,"Alonso, E.

Earlier low-resolution (beam > 24) data suggest that the CND is transient because of its low density. High-resolution (0.1 pc) data are awaited to confirm this. We found a molecular streamer, originating from the ambient clouds with progressively higher velocities as it approaches the CND, in our CS(2-1) map (beam=40"" (1.5 pc)). This shows evidence of gas replenishment onto the CND. This rises the question whether the streamer consists of dense cores that are able to resist tidal disruption. We propose to obtain a 0.1 parsec resolution map to resolve the dense cores feeding the GC along the streamer and its parent cloud with various density tracers.",gc_a_1_03_TM1,"Hwang, Chorng-Yuan; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick;",6.211320287107275,0.25088130026678257,2.9811856746673584,uid://A001/X899/Xbc,uid://A001/X899/Xbd,uid://A002/Xbc4a22/X2db9,Is the Molecular Inflow in the Galactic Center Transient?,S,TARGET,T,15.0049933723622,937500000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A006:DV15 A009:DV18 A010:DV23 A011:DV03 A013:DA53 A015:DA61 A027:DA56 A029:DA60 A030:DV16 A031:DA63 A033:DV07 A034:DA46 A036:DV20 A037:DV19 A039:DA58 A047:DA62 A048:DV10 A049:DA57 A051:DA65 A053:DV25 A060:DV06 A061:DA44 A062:DV14 A063:DV22 A064:DV13 A067:DV02 A068:DV08 A069:DA55 A070:DV12 A071:DA48 A072:DA47 A073:DA42 A074:DV09 A075:DV24 A076:DA54 A077:DA52 A078:DV05 A079:DA64 A080:DV11,T,2018-03-31T17:02:52.000,1.639444615910779,"[90.44..91.38GHz,488.28kHz,6.2mJy/beam@10km/s,353.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.67..100.61GHz,488.28kHz,6mJy/beam@10km/s,356.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",90.9133189166499,1468.544974390929,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",,,T,,Galactic centres/nuclei,Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,ari_l,HNC (1-0)

We propose a blind, complete spectral line survey covering bands 3-7 of a single pointing in the CMZ to determine which lines can be used to trace: (1) protostellar cores, (2) turbulent shocks, (3) diffuse and quiescent molecular gas, and (4) protostellar outflows in the CMZ. We will run this program as a legacy survey, releasing data immediately, and we will produce data products that will inform ongoing and future CMZ programs.",BrickMas_b_06_TM1,"Longmore, Steven; Barnes, Ashley; Walker, Daniel; Kauffmann, Jens; Mills, Elisabeth; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Battersby, Cara; Meier, David; Ott, Juergen; Sanchez-Monge, Alvaro; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett; Rosolowsky, Erik;",0.8144825779292025,0.012456927669940833,0.6683349013328552,uid://A001/X1465/X3a42,uid://A001/X1465/X3a43,uid://A002/Xe48598/X3475f,What lines trace which processes in the CMZ?,S,TARGET,T,10.095640158589392,1875000000.0,A002:DA44 A003:DV23 A004:DA56 A005:DV22 A006:DV13 A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A013:DV11 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A019:DA61 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A025:DV10 A026:DV18 A027:DV17 A028:DA59 A030:DA52 A031:DA62 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A036:DA64 A038:DA60 A039:DV16 A040:DA65 A041:DV03 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A046:DA51 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A072:DA53,F,2021-06-10T10:14:59.000,1.0408636162823248,"[241.68..243.56GHz,976.56kHz,837.4uJy/beam@10km/s,55uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [243.39..245.26GHz,976.56kHz,835.2uJy/beam@10km/s,55.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.09..246.96GHz,976.56kHz,833.1uJy/beam@10km/s,55.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [246.79..248.67GHz,976.56kHz,831uJy/beam@10km/s,55.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [248.50..250.37GHz,976.56kHz,828.9uJy/beam@10km/s,55.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [250.20..252.07GHz,976.56kHz,826.9uJy/beam@10km/s,55.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [251.90..253.78GHz,976.56kHz,824.9uJy/beam@10km/s,55.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [253.60..255.48GHz,976.56kHz,822.9uJy/beam@10km/s,55.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [255.31..257.18GHz,976.56kHz,820.9uJy/beam@10km/s,55.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [257.01..258.89GHz,976.56kHz,819uJy/beam@10km/s,55.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [257.68..259.56GHz,976.56kHz,818.3uJy/beam@10km/s,55.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [259.39..261.26GHz,976.56kHz,816.4uJy/beam@10km/s,55.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [261.09..262.96GHz,976.56kHz,814.5uJy/beam@10km/s,55.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [262.79..264.67GHz,976.56kHz,812.7uJy/beam@10km/s,55.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [264.50..266.37GHz,976.56kHz,821.6uJy/beam@10km/s,56.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [266.20..268.07GHz,976.56kHz,819.8uJy/beam@10km/s,56.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [267.90..269.78GHz,976.56kHz,818uJy/beam@10km/s,56.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [269.60..271.48GHz,976.56kHz,816.2uJy/beam@10km/s,56.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [271.31..273.18GHz,976.56kHz,814.5uJy/beam@10km/s,56.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [273.01..274.89GHz,976.56kHz,812.8uJy/beam@10km/s,56.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",272.2449843148772,1072.3433161655964,"Ginsburg, Adam",,,T,,"Astrochemistry, Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,HNC (3-2)

Therefore, it is essential that we understand the process of accretion and the physics of these accretion-fed outflows. Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) provide ideal laboratories for probing jet phenomena due to their rapid (day-week) evolution timescales. In particular, broad-band spectral measurements of jet emission in BHXBs during bright outburst periods allow us to constrain the physical conditions in the jet, which can then be coupled to the properties of the accretion flow, probing the mechanisms that govern how jets are launched and quenched. The mm/sub-mm regime bridges a crucial gap between radio and IR frequencies, as data in this regime are essential when performing detailed spectral modelling. We propose targeting the next outbursting BHXB with ALMA ToO observations, to accurately measure the evolving mm/sub-mm flux. Coupled with our exceptional multi-wavelength coverage, we will constrain the dynamic broad-band spectral energy distribution in BHXBs with unparalleled accuracy.",Transien_a_03_TM1,"Miller-Jones, James; Migliari, Simone; Heinz, Sebastian; Rupen, Michael; Russell, David; Sarazin, Craig; Altamirano, Diego; Russell, Thomas; Markoff, Sera; Sivakoff, Gregory;",2.853404009611579,0.056414984081013676,0.8823152780532837,uid://A001/X1527/X3f9,uid://A001/X1527/X3fa,uid://A002/Xec0d12/X3150,Constraining Jet Formation and Evolution with X-ray Binaries,T,PHASE WVR,F,7.85541646205656,1875000000.0,A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A011:DV07 A015:DV25 A022:DV01 A024:DA58 A027:DV17 A033:DA49 A035:DA43 A040:DA65 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A045:DA57 A047:DV06 A060:DA47 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A070:DA62 A072:DA53 A073:DA51 A074:DV09 A075:DV18 A076:DA56 A083:DA59 A085:DA60 A086:DV22 A087:DV03 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A091:DA61 A092:DV23 A093:DV04 A094:DV14 A104:DA45 A105:DV15 A108:DA50 A110:DA48 A111:DV19 A115:DA64 A120:DV12 A122:DA55 A123:DA63 A128:DV24 A135:DV10,F,2022-05-11T00:00:00.000,0.37404432381200703,"[89.54..91.41GHz,1128.91kHz,2.9mJy/beam@10km/s,114.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [91.54..93.41GHz,1128.91kHz,2.8mJy/beam@10km/s,112.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.58..103.45GHz,1128.91kHz,2.6mJy/beam@10km/s,112.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [103.58..105.45GHz,1128.91kHz,2.6mJy/beam@10km/s,112.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",90.47669991658043,3267.0945890744656,"Tetarenko, Alexandra",,,T,,"Black holes, Transients",Stars and stellar evolution,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,HNC (1-0)

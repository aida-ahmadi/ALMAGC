In the search for the building blocks of life, nitrogen-bearing molecules are of particular interest since nitrogen-containing bonds are essential for the linking of amino acids and ultimately the formation of larger biological structures. The elusive molecule methylamine (CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB>) is thought to be a key pre-biotic species but has so far only been securely detected in the giant molecular cloud Sagittarius B2. <BR /> Aims: We identify CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> and other simple nitrogen-bearing species involved in the synthesis of biologically relevant molecules towards three hot cores associated with the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6334I, located at a distance of 1.3 kpc. Column density ratios are derived in order to investigate the relevance of the individual species as precursors of biotic molecules. <BR /> Methods: High sensitivity, high angular and spectral resolution observations obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array were used to study transitions of CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB>, CH<SUB>2</SUB>NH, NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO, and the <SUP>13</SUP>C- and <SUP>15</SUP>N-methyl cyanide (CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN) isotopologues, detected towards NGC 6334I. Column densities are derived for each species assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and excitation temperatures in the range 220-340 K for CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB>, 70-110 K for the CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN isotopologues and 120-215 K for NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO and CH<SUB>2</SUB>NH. <BR /> Results: We report the first detections of CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> towards NGC 6334I with column density ratios with respect to CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH of 5.9 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>, 1.5 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> and 5.4 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> for the three hot cores MM1, MM2, and MM3, respectively. These values are slightly lower than the values derived for Sagittarius B2 but higher by more than an order of magnitude as compared with the values derived for the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422B. The column density ratios of NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO, <SUP>13</SUP>CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUP>15</SUP>N with respect to CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH are (1.5 - 1.9) × 10<SUP>-4</SUP>, (1.0 - 4.6) × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> and (1.7 - 3.0) × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> respectively. Lower limits of 5.2, 1.2, and 3.0 are reported for the CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> to CH<SUB>2</SUB>NH column density ratio for MM1, MM2, and MM3 respectively. These limits are largely consistent with the values derived for Sagittarius B2 and higher than those for IRAS 16293-2422B. <BR /> Conclusions: The detections of CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> in the hot cores of NGC 6334I hint that CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> is generally common in the interstellar medium, albeit that high-sensitivity observations are essential forthe detection of the species. The good agreement between model predictions of CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> ratios and the observations towards NGC 6334I indicate a main formation pathway via radical recombination on grain surfaces. This process may be stimulated further by high grain temperatures allowing a lager degree of radical mobility. Further observations with ALMA will help evaluate the degree to which CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> chemistry depends on the temperature of the grains in high- and low-mass star-forming regions respectively. ...(3)",2017,"The aim of this project is the first detection of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) in the interstellar medium. NH2OH is an important precursor in space for the formation of amino acids - the building blocks of life. Abundances within reach of ALMA are predicted from recent laboratory experiments in our group that have focused on the solid-state chemistry of nitrogen oxides in interstellar ice analogs. Our results show that for low temperatures, NO and NO2 ices are readily converted into NH2OH upon sequential hydrogenation, yielding a stable end-product. In warmer environments, NH2OH can thermally desorb, yielding detectable gas-phase abundances, while in shocked regions, the solid NH2OH can be liberated en masse into the gas phase.

The 89 GHz emission is area-filling, optically thick, and sub-thermally excited. Two types of filaments are seen in absorption against the HCO+ emission. Broad-line absorption filaments (BLAs) have widths of less than a few arcseconds (0.07-0.14 pc), lengths of 30-50 arcsec (1.2-1.8 pc), and absorption profiles extending over a velocity range larger than 20 km s–1. The BLAs are nearly parallel to the nearby G0.18 non-thermal filaments and may trace HCO+ molecules gyrating about highly ordered magnetic fields located in front of G0.253+0.016 or edge-on sheets formed behind supersonic shocks propagating orthogonal to our line of sight in the foreground. Narrow-line absorption filaments (NLAs) have line widths less than 20 km s–1. Some NLAs are also seen in absorption in other species with high optical depth, such as HCN, and occasionally in emission where the background is faint. The NLAs, which also trace low-density, sub-thermally excited HCO+ molecules, are mostly seen on the blueshifted side of the emission from G0.253+0.016. If associated with the surface of G0.253+0.016, the kinematics of the NLAs indicate that the cloud surface is expanding. The decompression of entrained, milli-Gauss magnetic fields may be responsible for the re-expansion of the surface layers of G0.253+0.016 as it recedes from the Galactic center following a close encounter with Sgr A. Despite the simplicity of theoretical models of supersonically turbulent, isothermal media, their predictions successfully match the observed gas structure and star formation activity within low-pressure (P/k &#60; 105 K cm–3) molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood. However, it is unknown whether or not these theories extend to clouds in high-pressure (P/k &#62; 107 K cm–3) environments, like those in the Galaxy's inner 200 pc central molecular zone (CMZ) and in the early universe. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 3 mm dust continuum emission within a cloud, G0.253+0.016, which is immersed in the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. While the log-normal shape and dispersion of its column density probability distribution function (PDF) are strikingly similar to those of solar neighborhood clouds, there is one important quantitative difference: its mean column density is one to two orders of magnitude higher. Both the similarity and difference in the PDF compared to those derived from solar neighborhood clouds match predictions of turbulent cloud models given the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. The PDF shows a small deviation from log-normal at high column densities confirming the youth of G0.253+0.016. Its lack of star formation is consistent with the theoretically predicted, environmentally dependent volume density threshold for star formation which is orders of magnitude higher than that derived for solar neighborhood clouds. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that the current theoretical understanding of molecular cloud structure derived from the solar neighborhood also holds in high-pressure environments. We therefore suggest that these theories may be applicable to understand star formation in the early universe. ...(9)",2014,"Clusters are the building blocks of galaxies and the nurseries of most stellar systems. Despite their importance, even the fundamental question of whether a single mechanism can describe cluster formation across the mass range from open clusters to globular clusters remains unclear. Answering this question requires observations of a cluster's natal dust and gas well before the onset of star formation. We have identified an extreme molecular cloud that appears to be on the verge of forming a massive cluster. This cloud, G0.25+0.02, is very cold, massive, and dense with no obvious star formation and shows tantalizing evidence that it is highly substructured and, thus, may be undergoing hierarchical fragmentation. Using the ALMA early science extended configuration we aim to obtain a ~3 x 1 arcmin mosaic of the dust continuum and molecular line emission across this cloud at 90 GHz. These observations will reveal the location, mass, and kinematics of the small-scale fragments within the cloud allowing us to distinguish between competing cluster formation models. These observations can only be achieved with the order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and dynamic range provided by ALMA. Determining whether clusters form via a single mechanism across the entire mass range has profound implications: if confirmed, this implies our knowledge of nearby cluster formation can be used as framework to understand star formation across cosmic time, back to globular clusters ~10Gyr ago.

Xue, Ci; Remijan, Anthony J.; Burkhardt, Andrew M.; Herbst, Eric","Aminoacetonitrile (NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) was detected in the interstellar medium (ISM) one decade ago in the course of a spectral survey of the hot molecular core Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) with the IRAM 30 m telescope. With the advent of sensitive telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the degree of chemical complexity in the ISM can be further explored. In the family of aminoacetonitrile, the next stage in complexity with one additional CH<SUB>2</SUB> group is aminopropionitrile. This molecule has two structural isomers, a chain-like (3-aminopropionitrile, NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) and a branched, chiral one (2-aminopropionitrile, CH<SUB>3</SUB>CH(NH<SUB>2</SUB>) CN). The latter was studied in the laboratory a few years ago and was not detected in the IRAM 30 m survey. We present the search for both isomers in the EMoCA (Exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA) survey, a sensitive spectral survey of Sgr B2(N) performed with ALMA. The rotational spectrum of 3-aminopropionitrile has been recorded in laboratory with a submillimeter spectrometer using solid-state sources. Helped by ab initio calculations performed for the different possible conformations, we present here the analysis based on a Watson Hamiltonian for an asymmetric one-top rotor in A-reduction performed in the frequency range 150-500 GHz for two conformers. More than 6200 lines of the ground-state and lowest excited vibrational states, corresponding to more than 8200 transitions, were assigned in the experimental spectrum. Partition functions, including the vibrational contribution of these states, and predictions in the JPL-CDMS catalog format were determined in order to search for both conformers of 3-aminopropionitrile in Sgr B2(N). Neither 3-aminopropionitrile, nor 2-aminopropionitrile are detected. The derived upper limits imply that they are at least 12 and 5 times less abundant than aminoacetonitrile, respectively. A comparison to ethyl cyanide and n-propyl cyanide detected in this source suggests that an improvement by a factor three in sensitivity may be sufficient to detect 3-aminopropionitrile, which should be within the range of our on-going follow-up project with ALMA. ...(20)",2014,"The search for complex pre-biotic and biotic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) will be a primary focus of ALMA science. The molecular inventory of meteorites found on Earth includes more than 80 distinct amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), and their composition suggests an interstellar origin. The key search site for new complex organics in the ISM is the hot dense core Sgr B2(N), due partly to its high column density. However, the firm identification of new molecules requires a robust spectral model to unweave the emission lines of weakly-emitting, more complex, species from known molecules. We have already constructed a unique model of this kind, using our previous single-dish line survey, which has already allowed our team to uncover several new species. We propose to use ALMA Early Science to perform a deep, unbiased line survey of Sgr B2(N) in band 3 (8 hours observing time). The proposed survey will improve the detection threshold for complex organic molecules by nearly a factor of 20 compared to our previous survey of this source. Such a sensitivity improvement should lead to the firm detection of a few, perhaps a dozen, new complex organics, while the adaptation of our existing spectral model will allow a rapid turn-around from detection to publication. The use of our team's cutting edge chemical models will allow the broader implications of new discoveries to be understood, and place strong constraints on chemical formation pathways. The discovery of biologically-relevant molecules in the ISM will be of high scientific impact, and is of broad appeal to the public and the media. The combination of ALMA's unique spectral sensitivity with our established methodologies will provide an efficient showcase of ALMA's capabilities in this field.",SgrB2_T1_B3_extended,"Garrod, Robin; Müller, Holger; Menten, Karl;",1.298451060581474,0.025781029807071847,2.8648860454559326,,uid://A002/X327408/Xe,uid://A002/X4b29af/X403,Expanding the frontiers of chemical complexity with ALMA,S,TARGET,T,14.493310845640975,1875000000.0,A003:DA41 A004:DV04 A008:DV19 A011:DV12 A015:DV21 A020:DV20 A025:DV14 A029:DA49 A045:DA50 A046:DA48 A050:DA42 A053:DV18 A067:DA46 A068:DA44 A069:DV16 A071:DV10 A072:DV13 A074:DV15 A075:DA43 A076:PM03 A077:DV02 A082:DV05 A137:DV03 A138:DV17 T702:PM02 T704:PM01,F,2014-09-12T00:00:00.000,1.6832138057818835,"[84.09..85.97GHz,488.28kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,51uJy/beam@native, XX] U [85.90..87.78GHz,488.28kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,51uJy/beam@native, XX] U [96.15..98.03GHz,488.28kHz,1.2mJy/beam@10km/s,51.1uJy/beam@native, XX] U [97.90..99.78GHz,488.28kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,53.1uJy/beam@native, XX]",86.84133869057675,1467.151766550663,"Belloche, Arnaud",ALMA Observations of the Spatial Distribution of Three C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> Isomers toward Sgr B2(N) Complex organic molecules in diffuse clouds along the line of sight to Sagittarius B2 Detection of a branched alkyl molecule in the inte,"Ando, Ryo Belloche, A.

Depending upon the mass of this gas reservoir, the fate of the CND (whether it will it form stars, or eventually accrete on the black hole) will have a substantial impact on the evolution of the central parsec of our Galaxy. Its fate depends upon its density: gas clumps with densities > 10^7 cm^-3 are stable, and can collapse and form stars, whereas unstable clumps should quickly be sheared apart and eventually accrete onto the black hole. We propose to use the resolution and sensitivity of Cycle 2 ALMA to conduct a robust probe of gas density on the scales of individual clumps (1"", or 0.04 pc) via simultaneous excitation analyses of multiple tracers and the inclusion of radiative excitation.

Classical hot cores are rich in molecular emission, and they show a high abundance of complex organic molecules (COMs). The emergence of molecular complexity that is represented by COMs, in particular, is poorly constrained in the early evolution of hot cores. <BR /> Aims: We put observational constraints on the physical location of COMs in a resolved high-mass protostellar envelope associated with the G328.2551-0.5321 clump. The protostar is single down to 400 au scales and we resolved the envelope structure down to this scale. <BR /> Methods: High angular resolution observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array allowed us to resolve the structure of the inner envelope and pin down the emission region of COMs. We use local thermodynamic equilibrium modelling of the available 7.5 GHz bandwidth around 345 GHz to identify the COMs towards two accretion shocks and a selected position representing the bulk emission of the inner envelope. We quantitatively discuss the derived molecular column densities and abundances towards these positions, and use our line identification to qualitatively compare this to the emission of COMs seen towards the central position, corresponding to the protostar and its accretion disk. <BR /> Results: We detect emission from 10 COMs, and identify a line of deuterated water (HDO). In addition to methanol (CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), methyl formate (CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO) and formamide (HC(O)NH<SUB>2</SUB>) have the most extended emission. Together with HDO, these molecules are found to be associated with both the accretion shocks and the inner envelope, which has a moderate temperature of T<SUB>kin</SUB> 110 K. We find a significant difference in the distribution of COMs. O-bearing COMs, such as ethanol, acetone, and ethylene glycol are almost exclusively found and show a higher abundance towards the accretion shocks with T<SUB>kin</SUB> 180 K. Whereas N-bearing COMs with a CN group, such as vinyl and ethyl cyanide peak on the central position, thus the protostar and the accretion disk. The molecular composition is similar towards the two shock positions, while it is significantly different towards the inner envelope, suggesting an increase in abundance of O-bearing COMs towards the accretion shocks. <BR /> Conclusions: We present the first observational evidence for a large column density of COMs seen towards accretion shocks at the centrifugal barrier at the inner envelope. The overall molecular emission shows increased molecular abundances of COMs towards the accretion shocks compared to the inner envelope. The bulk of the gas from the inner envelope is still at a moderate temperature of T<SUB>kin</SUB> 110 K, and we find that the radiatively heated inner region is very compact (&lt;1000 au). Since the molecular composition is dominated by that of the accretion shocks and the radiatively heated hot inner region is very compact, we propose this source to be a precursor to a classical, radiatively heated hot core. By imaging the physical location of HDO, we find that it is consistent with an origin within the moderately heated inner envelope, suggesting that it originates from sublimation of ice from the grain surface and its destruction in the vicinity of the heating source has not been efficient yet. <P />A copy of the reduced datacubes is available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/632/A57"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/632/A57</A> ...(6)",2017,"The origin of massive stars is a fundamental open issue in modern astrophysics.

Depending upon the mass of this gas reservoir, the fate of the CND (whether it will it form stars, or eventually accrete on the black hole) will have a substantial impact on the evolution of the central parsec of our Galaxy. Its fate depends upon its density: gas clumps with densities > 10^7 cm^-3 are stable, and can collapse and form stars, whereas unstable clumps should quickly be sheared apart and eventually accrete onto the black hole. We propose to use the resolution and sensitivity of Cycle 2 ALMA to conduct a robust probe of gas density on the scales of individual clumps (1"", or 0.04 pc) via simultaneous excitation analyses of multiple tracers and the inclusion of radiative excitation. Ultimately, this study will yield the authoritative values for the CND mass and density, quantities which vary in recent literature by 3-4 orders of magnitude, and will indicate the amount of gas present in the central parsecs, and whether it will feed the central black hole or contribute to a nuclear starburst.",Circumnu_a_03_TC,"Harada, Nanase; Zhao, Jun-Hui; Morris, Mark; Wardle, Mark; Riquelme, Denise; Moser, Lydia; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Ho, Paul; Martin, Sergio; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Guesten, Rolf; Ginsburg, Adam;",6.5629898416639545,0.13081714027946606,5.132266044616699,uid://A001/X121/X2e0,uid://A001/X121/X2e3,uid://A002/X95e355/X1d46,The Density (and Destiny) of the Circumnuclear Disk,S,TARGET,T,32.38460220597527,1875000000.0,A001:DA58 A002:DV16 A004:DV24 A005:DV25 A006:DA42 A011:DV22 A015:DV18 A016:DV04 A018:DA63 A019:DA54 A023:DV11 A024:DV10 A027:DV13 A030:DA45 A031:DV08 A034:DV20 A035:DA52 A037:DV12 A038:DV07 A040:DA43 A042:DV17 A043:DA48 A044:DV15 A046:DA62 A050:DV14 A058:DA46 A060:DA55 A068:DA44 A071:DA50 A075:DA61 A137:DA41,T,2016-03-30T14:13:55.000,2.759713093442905,"[85.56..87.43GHz,1128.91kHz,6.6mJy/beam@10km/s,257.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.50..89.37GHz,1128.91kHz,6.5mJy/beam@10km/s,257.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.56..99.43GHz,1128.91kHz,6.2mJy/beam@10km/s,258.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.56..101.43GHz,1128.91kHz,6.5mJy/beam@10km/s,274.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",86.4946727026277,3336.566520437492,"Mills, Elisabeth",,,T,,"Starbursts, star formation, Galactic centres/nuclei",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,ari_l,SiO (2-1)

P.; Bergin, E.; Comito, C.; Möller, Th.","Context. Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

This will be aided by the availability of full HIFI line surveys of both sources, which will give important constraints.",sgrb2_n_b_06_TE,"Schmiedeke, Anika; Bergin, Edwin; Sanchez-Monge, Alvaro; Müller, Holger; Qin, Sheng-Li; Lis, Dariusz; Comito, Claudia;",1.574728131418796,0.02428822917904063,1.2611926794052124,uid://A001/X12b/X14,uid://A001/X12b/X15,uid://A002/X835491/X817,Physical and chemical structure of massive proto-clusters,S,TARGET WVR,T,5.263992638087354,1875000000.0,A007:DV22 A007:DV23 A010:DV02 A010:DV12 A011:DV04 A011:DV22 A015:DV18 A016:DA62 A017:DA57 A019:DA63 A021:DA59 A029:DA49 A031:DV08 A031:DV11 A033:DV18 A033:DV19 A034:DV20 A035:DA52 A036:DA60 A038:DV07 A042:DV17 A046:DA48 A046:DA62 A056:DV25 A058:DA46 A062:DV05 A063:DA54 A066:DA64 A067:DV13 A067:DV21 A068:DA44 A069:DA53 A069:DV16 A070:DA45 A070:DA47 A071:DV10 A072:DV01 A073:DA63 A074:DA47 A074:DV10 A075:DA61 A076:DA57 A077:DV16 A078:DV04 A078:DV15 A079:DA43 A080:DA55 A080:DV24 A081:DA42 A081:DV09 A082:DA51 A083:DV14 A083:DV25 A084:DV11 A085:DA51 A085:DA64 A087:DV02 A087:DV23 A090:DA60 A091:DA43 A137:DA41 A138:DV14 A138:DV17 T701:PM03 T703:PM04,F,2016-08-07T11:05:20.000,0.5020280348497802,"[240.12..242.00GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108uJy/beam@native, XX] U [241.99..243.88GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108.1uJy/beam@native, XX] U [243.87..245.75GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108.2uJy/beam@native, XX] U [245.74..247.63GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108.3uJy/beam@native, XX] U [247.62..249.50GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [249.49..251.38GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108.5uJy/beam@native, XX] U [251.37..253.25GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,108.6uJy/beam@native, XX] U [253.24..255.13GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,106.9uJy/beam@native, XX] U [255.12..257.00GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107uJy/beam@native, XX] U [256.12..258.00GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107uJy/beam@native, XX] U [256.99..258.87GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107.1uJy/beam@native, XX] U [257.99..259.87GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107.1uJy/beam@native, XX] U [259.87..261.75GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107.3uJy/beam@native, XX] U [261.74..263.62GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [263.62..265.50GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107.5uJy/beam@native, XX] U [265.49..267.37GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,107.6uJy/beam@native, XX] U [267.37..269.25GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,112.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [269.24..271.12GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,112.5uJy/beam@native, XX] U [271.12..273.00GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,112.7uJy/beam@native, XX] U [272.99..274.87GHz,564.45kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,112.8uJy/beam@native, XX]",260.8084009662024,615.5878353506134,"Schilke, Peter",STATCONT: A statistical continuum level determination method for line-rich sources The physical and chemical structure of Sagittarius B2.

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage. ...(2)",2016,"The Galactic center uniquely provides the opportunities to resolve how the supermassive black hole accrete in inner than 5 pc scale.

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage.",2016,"Previous observations of hydrogen recombination lines toward the Galactic center detected ionized mini spiral arms, which appear to be material that is gravitationally accreted toward the Galactic supermassive black hole SgrA*. The new capabilities offered by Cycle 2 ALMA in band 9 allow us to probe the very hot neutral counterpart in the very central region. By observing the spatial distribution, the velocity, and the linewidth of this gas, we will determine how closely the hot neutral material can approach SgrA*, without being ionized, and to constrain the excitation conditions of this material within a ~0.1 pc radius. The optimal tracer of this material is multiple, highly-excited molecular transitions, which will better differentiate zone of different excitations, and provide more information on the kinematics of the accretion flow than observations of the hydrogen recombination line.",SgrA_sta_c_09_TE,"Minh, Young; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Hsieh, Pei-Ying; Su, Yu-Nung;",25.860848968928856,1.431007677364692,0.4197227656841278,uid://A001/X122/X416,uid://A001/X122/X417,uid://A002/X9fa4e2/X27cd,Defining the Neutral Material which Survives to within 0.1 parsec of the Galactic Supermassive Black Hole,S,TARGET,T,3.329680408109562,1875000000.0,A001:DA58 A002:DV16 A004:DV24 A010:DV02 A013:DA51 A015:DV18 A017:DA57 A018:DA63 A019:DA54 A021:DA59 A023:DV11 A024:DV10 A026:DV09 A027:DV13 A029:DA49 A030:DA45 A031:DV08 A033:DV19 A034:DV20 A035:DA52 A036:DA60 A037:DV12 A038:DV07 A040:DA43 A046:DA62 A050:DV14 A058:DA46 A060:DA55 A062:DV05 A066:DA64 A067:DV21 A068:DA44 A069:DA53 A070:DA47 A071:DA50 A075:DA61 A137:DA41,T,2017-09-22T00:00:00.000,0.3194734047456428,"[687.80..689.67GHz,3904.30kHz,25.7mJy/beam@10km/s,2.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [689.63..691.50GHz,3904.30kHz,25.8mJy/beam@10km/s,2.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [691.44..693.31GHz,3904.30kHz,25.8mJy/beam@10km/s,2.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [693.24..695.11GHz,3904.30kHz,25.9mJy/beam@10km/s,2.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",694.1731858237665,1683.701918635194,"Ho, Paul",Linearly polarized millimeter and submillimeter continuum emission of Sgr A* constrained by ALMA,"Liu, Hauyu Baobab",T,2016A&A...593A.107L,Galactic centres/nuclei,Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,ari_l,SiO (16-15)

These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of ˜25 μJy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on ≥5σ detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S 1.2 mm ≥ 0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 μm and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2×. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs—representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies—in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution. We present the first determination of the abundance ratios of <SUP>13</SUP>C substitutions of cyanoacetylene (HC<SUB>3</SUB>N), [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN], in Titan's atmosphere measured using millimeter-wave spectra obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. To compare the line intensities precisely, data sets that include multiple molecular lines were extracted to suppress effects of Titan's environmental conditions and observation settings. The [HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] and [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] ratios were obtained from 12 and 1 selected data sets, respectively.

We also develop a physical basis and empirical calibration (with 72 low-z and z ˜ 2 galaxies) for using the dust continuum as a quantitative probe of ISM masses. The galaxies with the highest star formation rates (SFRs) at &#60; z&#62; = 2.2 and 4.4 have gas masses up to 100 times that of the Milky Way and gas mass fractions reaching 50%-80%, i.e., gas masses 1-4× their stellar masses. We find a single high-z star formation law: {SFR}=35 {M}{mol}0.89× {(1+z)}z=20.95× {({sSFR})}{MS}0.23 {M}⊙ yr-1—an approximately linear dependence on the ISM mass and an increased star formation efficiency per unit gas mass at higher redshift. Galaxies above the main sequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on a timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS; thus, these “starbursts” are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses rather than an increased efficiency of converting gas to stars. At z &#62; 1, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has ˜2-5 times shorter gas depletion times than low-z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate a different mode of star formation in the early universe—most likely dynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions—a natural consequence of the high gas accretion rates. ALMA observations of the long wavelength dust continuum are used to estimate the interstellar medium (ISM) masses in a sample of 708 galaxies at z = 0.3 to 4.5 in the COSMOS field. The galaxy sample has known far-infrared luminosities and, hence, star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses ({M}* ) from the optical–infrared spectrum fitting. The galaxies sample SFRs from the main sequence (MS) to 50 times above the MS. The derived ISM masses are used to determine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, {M}* , and specific SFR (sSFR) relative to the MS. The ISM masses increase approximately with the 0.63 power of the rate of increase in SFRs with redshift and the 0.32 power of the sSFR/sSFRMS. The SF efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the SFR redshift evolution and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the MS; thus the increased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased ISM masses and SF efficiency.

B.","ALMA Cycle 2 observations of long-wavelength dust emission in 145 star-forming galaxies are used to probe the evolution of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM). We also develop a physical basis and empirical calibration (with 72 low-z and z ˜ 2 galaxies) for using the dust continuum as a quantitative probe of ISM masses. The galaxies with the highest star formation rates (SFRs) at &#60; z&#62; = 2.2 and 4.4 have gas masses up to 100 times that of the Milky Way and gas mass fractions reaching 50%-80%, i.e., gas masses 1-4× their stellar masses. We find a single high-z star formation law: {SFR}=35 {M}{mol}0.89× {(1+z)}z=20.95× {({sSFR})}{MS}0.23 {M}⊙ yr-1—an approximately linear dependence on the ISM mass and an increased star formation efficiency per unit gas mass at higher redshift. Galaxies above the main sequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on a timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS; thus, these “starbursts” are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses rather than an increased efficiency of converting gas to stars. At z &#62; 1, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has ˜2-5 times shorter gas depletion times than low-z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate a different mode of star formation in the early universe—most likely dynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions—a natural consequence of the high gas accretion rates. ALMA observations of the long wavelength dust continuum are used to estimate the interstellar medium (ISM) masses in a sample of 708 galaxies at z = 0.3 to 4.5 in the COSMOS field. The galaxy sample has known far-infrared luminosities and, hence, star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses ({M}* ) from the optical–infrared spectrum fitting. The galaxies sample SFRs from the main sequence (MS) to 50 times above the MS. The derived ISM masses are used to determine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, {M}* , and specific SFR (sSFR) relative to the MS. The ISM masses increase approximately with the 0.63 power of the rate of increase in SFRs with redshift and the 0.32 power of the sSFR/sSFRMS. The SF efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the SFR redshift evolution and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the MS; thus the increased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased ISM masses and SF efficiency. Using the derived ISM mass function, we estimate the accretion rates of gas required to maintain continuity of the MS evolution (&#62; 100 {M}ȯ yr‑1 at z &#62; 2.5). Simple power-law dependencies are similarly derived for the gas accretion rates. We argue that the overall evolution of galaxies is driven by the rates of gas accretion.

We also develop a physical basis and empirical calibration (with 72 low-z and z ˜ 2 galaxies) for using the dust continuum as a quantitative probe of ISM masses. The galaxies with the highest star formation rates (SFRs) at &#60; z&#62; = 2.2 and 4.4 have gas masses up to 100 times that of the Milky Way and gas mass fractions reaching 50%-80%, i.e., gas masses 1-4× their stellar masses. We find a single high-z star formation law: {SFR}=35 {M}{mol}0.89× {(1+z)}z=20.95× {({sSFR})}{MS}0.23 {M}⊙ yr-1—an approximately linear dependence on the ISM mass and an increased star formation efficiency per unit gas mass at higher redshift. Galaxies above the main sequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on a timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS; thus, these “starbursts” are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses rather than an increased efficiency of converting gas to stars. At z &#62; 1, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has ˜2-5 times shorter gas depletion times than low-z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate a different mode of star formation in the early universe—most likely dynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions—a natural consequence of the high gas accretion rates. ALMA observations of the long wavelength dust continuum are used to estimate the interstellar medium (ISM) masses in a sample of 708 galaxies at z = 0.3 to 4.5 in the COSMOS field. The galaxy sample has known far-infrared luminosities and, hence, star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses ({M}* ) from the optical–infrared spectrum fitting. The galaxies sample SFRs from the main sequence (MS) to 50 times above the MS. The derived ISM masses are used to determine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, {M}* , and specific SFR (sSFR) relative to the MS. The ISM masses increase approximately with the 0.63 power of the rate of increase in SFRs with redshift and the 0.32 power of the sSFR/sSFRMS. The SF efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the SFR redshift evolution and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the MS; thus the increased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased ISM masses and SF efficiency. Using the derived ISM mass function, we estimate the accretion rates of gas required to maintain continuity of the MS evolution (&#62; 100 {M}ȯ yr‑1 at z &#62; 2.5). Simple power-law dependencies are similarly derived for the gas accretion rates. We argue that the overall evolution of galaxies is driven by the rates of gas accretion. The cosmic evolution of total ISM mass is estimated and linked to the evolution of SF and active galactic nucleus activity at early epochs. ...(4)",2016,"The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) of starforming and AGN sources cannot be probed directly from the ground or from space; their EUV are thus very poorly constrained. Our recent theoretical work demonstrates that the mm/submm recombination lines of HI and HeII are excellent probes of the EUV: they have little dust absorption, they arise from H and He (thus independent of metallicity) and their fluxes depend linearly on number of EUV continuum photons. The He++ region (producing HeII emission) requires 54 ev photons, thus the EUV hardness is directly proportional to the HeII/HI flux ratio. We propose observations of HI and HeII in compact OB star regions and galactic nuclei (SgrA* and NGC 1068). These observations will demonstrate the potential of the HI and HeII lines -- opening a new observing window on the EUV. Themeasured hardness of the EUV spectra will provide critical input to starburstsynthesis models. Based on prior near infrared line detections, we confidently expect expect detectios of the line emission in both SgrA* and NGC 1068.

An intermittent jet likely formed this channel and is consistent with earlier evidence of a sustained, Seyfert-level outburst fueled by black hole accretion onto Sgr A* several Myr ago. Therefore, to trace a now weak jet that perhaps penetrated, deflected, and percolated along multiple paths through the interstellar medium, relevant interactions are identified and quantified in archival X-ray images, Hubble Space Telescope Paschen α images and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array millimeter-wave spectra, and new SOAR telescope IR spectra. Hydrodynamical simulations are used to show how a nuclear jet can explain these structures and inflate the ROSAT/eROSITA X-ray and Fermi γ-ray bubbles that extend ± 75° from the Galactic plane. Thus, our Galactic outflow has features in common with energetic, jet-driven structures in the prototypical Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The Galactic center 50 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> molecular cloud (50MC) is the most remarkable molecular cloud in the Sagittarius A region. This cloud is a candidate for the massive star formation induced by cloud─cloud collision (CCC) with a collision velocity of ∼30 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> that is estimated from the velocity dispersion. We observed the whole of the 50MC with a high angular resolution (∼2.″0 × 1.″4) in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array cycle 1 in the H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 and C<SUP>34</SUP>S J = 2−1 emission lines. We identified 241 and 129 bound cores with a virial parameter of less than 2, which are thought to be gravitationally bound, in the H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUP>34</SUP>S maps using the clumpfind algorithm, respectively. In the CCC region, the bound H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUP>34</SUP>S cores are 119 and 82, whose masses are 68% and 76% of those in the whole 50MC, respectively. The distribution of the core number and column densities in the CCC are biased to larger densities than those in the non-CCC region. The distributions indicate that the CCC compresses the molecular gas and increases the number of the dense bound cores. Additionally, the massive bound cores with masses of &gt;3000 M <SUB>☉</SUB> exist only in the CCC region, although the slope of the core mass function (CMF) in the CCC region is not different from that in the non-CCC region. We conclude that the compression by the CCC efficiently formed massive bound cores even if the slope of the CMF is not changed so much by the CCC. ...(6)",2016,"In recent two decades, the young and highly luminous clusters in the Galactic center region, including Arches cluster, Quintuplet cluster, and Central cluster have been found by IR observations. The molecular clouds in the region are much denser, warmer, and more turbulent than disk molecular clouds. They are presumably the cradles of these bright star clusters. It is, however, an open question as to what mechanism is responsible for the formation of such star clusters in the cloud. The Galactic center 50 km s-1 molecular cloud is a most promising test bed to study of the star formation mechanism in the region. The core mass function of the clouds (CMF) is believed to be important for diagnosis of the star formation even in the Galactic center region. We propose multi-spices (CS, C34S, C33S, thermal SiO, H13CO+ and H42α) and wide-field imaging observations covering the whole cloud with mosaic method using ALMA to derive the CMF and size spectrum and to examine their positional deference in the cloud.

The images unveil the presence of small spatial scale <SUP>12</SUP>CO (J = 3-2) molecular ""cloudlets"" (≲20 000 AU size) within the central parsec of the Milky Way, in other words, inside the cavity of the CND, and moving at high speeds, up to 300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> along the line-of-sight. The <SUP>12</SUP>CO-emitting structures show intricate morphologies: extended and filamentary at high negative-velocities (v<SUB>LSR</SUB> ≲-150 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), more localized and clumpy at extreme positive-velocities (v<SUB>LSR</SUB> ≳+200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). Based on the pencil-beam <SUP>12</SUP>CO absorption spectrum toward Sgr A<SUP>*</SUP> synchrotron emission, we also present evidence for a diffuse molecular gas component producing absorption features at more extreme negative-velocities (v<SUB>LSR</SUB> &lt; -200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CND shows a clumpy spatial distribution traced by the optically thin H<SUP>13</SUP>CN (J = 4-3) emission. Its motion requires a bundle of non-uniformly rotating streams of slightly different inclinations. The inferred gas density peaks, molecular cores of several 10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, are lower than the local Roche limit. This supports that CND cores are transient. We apply the two standard orbit models, spirals vs. ellipses, invoked to explain the kinematics of the ionized gas streamers around Sgr A<SUP>*</SUP>. The location and velocities of the <SUP>12</SUP>CO cloudlets inside the cavity are inconsistent with the spiral model, and only two of them are consistent with the Keplerian ellipse model. Most cloudlets, however, show similar velocities that are incompatible with the motions of the ionized streamers or with gas bounded to the central gravity. We speculate that they are leftovers of more massive molecular clouds that fall into the cavity and are tidally disrupted, or that they originate from instabilities in the inner rim of the CND that lead to fragmentation and infall from there. In either case, we show that molecular cloudlets, all together with a mass of several 10 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, exist around Sgr A<SUP>*</SUP>. Most of them must be short-lived, ≲10<SUP>4</SUP> yr: photoevaporated by the intense stellar radiation field, G<SUB>0</SUB> ≃ 10<SUP>5.3</SUP>-10<SUP>4.3</SUP>, blown away by winds from massive stars in the central cluster, or disrupted by strong gravitational shears.

Depending upon the mass of this gas reservoir, the fate of the CND (whether it will it form stars, or eventually accrete on the black hole) will have a substantial impact on the evolution of the central parsec of our Galaxy. Its fate depends upon its density: gas clumps with densities > 10^7 cm^-3 are stable, and can collapse and form stars, whereas unstable clumps should quickly be sheared apart and eventually accrete onto the black hole. We propose to use the resolution and sensitivity of Cycle 2 ALMA to conduct a robust probe of gas density on the scales of individual clumps (1"", or 0.04 pc) via simultaneous excitation analyses of multiple tracers and the inclusion of radiative excitation.

The images unveil the presence of small spatial scale <SUP>12</SUP>CO (J = 3-2) molecular ""cloudlets"" (≲20 000 AU size) within the central parsec of the Milky Way, in other words, inside the cavity of the CND, and moving at high speeds, up to 300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> along the line-of-sight. The <SUP>12</SUP>CO-emitting structures show intricate morphologies: extended and filamentary at high negative-velocities (v<SUB>LSR</SUB> ≲-150 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), more localized and clumpy at extreme positive-velocities (v<SUB>LSR</SUB> ≳+200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). Based on the pencil-beam <SUP>12</SUP>CO absorption spectrum toward Sgr A<SUP>*</SUP> synchrotron emission, we also present evidence for a diffuse molecular gas component producing absorption features at more extreme negative-velocities (v<SUB>LSR</SUB> &lt; -200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CND shows a clumpy spatial distribution traced by the optically thin H<SUP>13</SUP>CN (J = 4-3) emission. Its motion requires a bundle of non-uniformly rotating streams of slightly different inclinations. The inferred gas density peaks, molecular cores of several 10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, are lower than the local Roche limit. This supports that CND cores are transient. We apply the two standard orbit models, spirals vs. ellipses, invoked to explain the kinematics of the ionized gas streamers around Sgr A<SUP>*</SUP>. The location and velocities of the <SUP>12</SUP>CO cloudlets inside the cavity are inconsistent with the spiral model, and only two of them are consistent with the Keplerian ellipse model. Most cloudlets, however, show similar velocities that are incompatible with the motions of the ionized streamers or with gas bounded to the central gravity. We speculate that they are leftovers of more massive molecular clouds that fall into the cavity and are tidally disrupted, or that they originate from instabilities in the inner rim of the CND that lead to fragmentation and infall from there. In either case, we show that molecular cloudlets, all together with a mass of several 10 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, exist around Sgr A<SUP>*</SUP>. Most of them must be short-lived, ≲10<SUP>4</SUP> yr: photoevaporated by the intense stellar radiation field, G<SUB>0</SUB> ≃ 10<SUP>5.3</SUP>-10<SUP>4.3</SUP>, blown away by winds from massive stars in the central cluster, or disrupted by strong gravitational shears.

We will use ALMA to resolve the spatial structures and kinematical patterns associated with the high-velocity CO line emission at the interface between the circum-nuclear disk and the inner central cavity. This component is beam diluted in our single-dish Herschel observations of the complete CO rotational ladder but can be inferred from the line profiles. Our observations using all 3 instruments on board Herschel have also revealed the presence of overabundant H2O and OH, as well as unexpected hot CO in the vicinity of SgrA*.

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage. ...(2)",2016,"The Galactic center uniquely provides the opportunities to resolve how the supermassive black hole accrete in inner than 5 pc scale.

An intermittent jet likely formed this channel and is consistent with earlier evidence of a sustained, Seyfert-level outburst fueled by black hole accretion onto Sgr A* several Myr ago. Therefore, to trace a now weak jet that perhaps penetrated, deflected, and percolated along multiple paths through the interstellar medium, relevant interactions are identified and quantified in archival X-ray images, Hubble Space Telescope Paschen α images and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array millimeter-wave spectra, and new SOAR telescope IR spectra. Hydrodynamical simulations are used to show how a nuclear jet can explain these structures and inflate the ROSAT/eROSITA X-ray and Fermi γ-ray bubbles that extend ± 75° from the Galactic plane. Thus, our Galactic outflow has features in common with energetic, jet-driven structures in the prototypical Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The Galactic center 50 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> molecular cloud (50MC) is the most remarkable molecular cloud in the Sagittarius A region. This cloud is a candidate for the massive star formation induced by cloud─cloud collision (CCC) with a collision velocity of ∼30 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> that is estimated from the velocity dispersion. We observed the whole of the 50MC with a high angular resolution (∼2.″0 × 1.″4) in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array cycle 1 in the H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 and C<SUP>34</SUP>S J = 2−1 emission lines. We identified 241 and 129 bound cores with a virial parameter of less than 2, which are thought to be gravitationally bound, in the H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUP>34</SUP>S maps using the clumpfind algorithm, respectively. In the CCC region, the bound H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUP>34</SUP>S cores are 119 and 82, whose masses are 68% and 76% of those in the whole 50MC, respectively. The distribution of the core number and column densities in the CCC are biased to larger densities than those in the non-CCC region. The distributions indicate that the CCC compresses the molecular gas and increases the number of the dense bound cores. Additionally, the massive bound cores with masses of &gt;3000 M <SUB>☉</SUB> exist only in the CCC region, although the slope of the core mass function (CMF) in the CCC region is not different from that in the non-CCC region. We conclude that the compression by the CCC efficiently formed massive bound cores even if the slope of the CMF is not changed so much by the CCC. ...(6)",2016,"In recent two decades, the young and highly luminous clusters in the Galactic center region, including Arches cluster, Quintuplet cluster, and Central cluster have been found by IR observations. The molecular clouds in the region are much denser, warmer, and more turbulent than disk molecular clouds. They are presumably the cradles of these bright star clusters. It is, however, an open question as to what mechanism is responsible for the formation of such star clusters in the cloud. The Galactic center 50 km s-1 molecular cloud is a most promising test bed to study of the star formation mechanism in the region.

An intermittent jet likely formed this channel and is consistent with earlier evidence of a sustained, Seyfert-level outburst fueled by black hole accretion onto Sgr A* several Myr ago. Therefore, to trace a now weak jet that perhaps penetrated, deflected, and percolated along multiple paths through the interstellar medium, relevant interactions are identified and quantified in archival X-ray images, Hubble Space Telescope Paschen α images and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array millimeter-wave spectra, and new SOAR telescope IR spectra. Hydrodynamical simulations are used to show how a nuclear jet can explain these structures and inflate the ROSAT/eROSITA X-ray and Fermi γ-ray bubbles that extend ± 75° from the Galactic plane. Thus, our Galactic outflow has features in common with energetic, jet-driven structures in the prototypical Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The Galactic center 50 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> molecular cloud (50MC) is the most remarkable molecular cloud in the Sagittarius A region. This cloud is a candidate for the massive star formation induced by cloud─cloud collision (CCC) with a collision velocity of ∼30 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> that is estimated from the velocity dispersion. We observed the whole of the 50MC with a high angular resolution (∼2.″0 × 1.″4) in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array cycle 1 in the H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 and C<SUP>34</SUP>S J = 2−1 emission lines. We identified 241 and 129 bound cores with a virial parameter of less than 2, which are thought to be gravitationally bound, in the H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUP>34</SUP>S maps using the clumpfind algorithm, respectively. In the CCC region, the bound H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUP>34</SUP>S cores are 119 and 82, whose masses are 68% and 76% of those in the whole 50MC, respectively. The distribution of the core number and column densities in the CCC are biased to larger densities than those in the non-CCC region. The distributions indicate that the CCC compresses the molecular gas and increases the number of the dense bound cores. Additionally, the massive bound cores with masses of &gt;3000 M <SUB>☉</SUB> exist only in the CCC region, although the slope of the core mass function (CMF) in the CCC region is not different from that in the non-CCC region. We conclude that the compression by the CCC efficiently formed massive bound cores even if the slope of the CMF is not changed so much by the CCC. ...(6)",2016,"In recent two decades, the young and highly luminous clusters in the Galactic center region, including Arches cluster, Quintuplet cluster, and Central cluster have been found by IR observations. The molecular clouds in the region are much denser, warmer, and more turbulent than disk molecular clouds. They are presumably the cradles of these bright star clusters. It is, however, an open question as to what mechanism is responsible for the formation of such star clusters in the cloud. The Galactic center 50 km s-1 molecular cloud is a most promising test bed to study of the star formation mechanism in the region. The core mass function of the clouds (CMF) is believed to be important for diagnosis of the star formation even in the Galactic center region.

In this project, we propose a focused ALMA experiment to detect DCN and DCO+ at where the exterior gas streams may be merging into the hot CND.

Previous works have shown that the molecular gas have two distinct velocity components, one associated with the X1-orbits and the other associated with the X2-orbits (in a barred potential model).

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars.

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage.",2016,"Previous observations of hydrogen recombination lines toward the Galactic center detected ionized mini spiral arms, which appear to be material that is gravitationally accreted toward the Galactic supermassive black hole SgrA*. The new capabilities offered by Cycle 2 ALMA in band 9 allow us to probe the very hot neutral counterpart in the very central region. By observing the spatial distribution, the velocity, and the linewidth of this gas, we will determine how closely the hot neutral material can approach SgrA*, without being ionized, and to constrain the excitation conditions of this material within a ~0.1 pc radius. The optimal tracer of this material is multiple, highly-excited molecular transitions, which will better differentiate zone of different excitations, and provide more information on the kinematics of the accretion flow than observations of the hydrogen recombination line.",SgrA_sta_c_09_7M,"Minh, Young; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Hsieh, Pei-Ying; Su, Yu-Nung;",149.37638820510978,7.066623355935887,0.6600000262260437,uid://A001/X122/X416,uid://A001/X122/X419,uid://A002/X87b480/X780,Defining the Neutral Material which Survives to within 0.1 parsec of the Galactic Supermassive Black Hole,S,TARGET,T,10.102291884991214,1992187500.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2021-04-21T00:00:00.000,1.6946444591268783,"[687.74..689.73GHz,3904.30kHz,138.3mJy/beam@10km/s,14.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [687.74..689.73GHz,3904.30kHz,187.3mJy/beam@10km/s,20.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [689.57..691.56GHz,3904.30kHz,133.4mJy/beam@10km/s,14.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [691.38..693.37GHz,3904.30kHz,141.9mJy/beam@10km/s,15.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [693.18..695.17GHz,3904.30kHz,149.4mJy/beam@10km/s,16.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",694.1731986970177,1683.7764718308233,"Ho, Paul",Linearly polarized millimeter and submillimeter continuum emission of Sgr A* constrained by ALMA,"Liu, Hauyu Baobab",T,2016A&A...593A.107L,Galactic centres/nuclei,Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (16-15)

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds. The observations requested here will constitute the most comprehensive survey of CMZ molecular clouds yet. This economic project (4 hours of main array time) will greatly help to lead CMZ research towards work on more representative cloud samples.",SgrB1-of_a_06_TM1,"Zhang, Qizhou; Goldsmith, Paul; Lu, Xing; Immer, Katharina; Menten, Karl; Lis, Dariusz; Pillai, Thushara; Ginsburg, Adam;",6.7875047822087335,0.2987574007202951,1.030968427658081,uid://A001/X88f/X12b,uid://A001/X88f/X12c,uid://A002/Xbd203b/X29f8,"Formation, State, and Structure of all Major CMZ Clouds",S,TARGET,T,10.17794116677776,937500000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A005:DA43 A006:DV15 A007:DV04 A009:DV18 A010:DV23 A011:DV03 A013:DA53 A014:DV17 A015:DA61 A017:DV24 A018:DV09 A019:DA42 A021:DA44 A022:DA48 A023:DA51 A024:DA64 A025:DA52 A026:DA54 A027:DA56 A031:DA63 A034:DA46 A038:DA47 A039:DA58 A042:DV05 A046:DA50 A047:DA62 A048:DV10 A049:DA57 A053:DV25 A060:DV06 A062:DV14 A063:DV22 A064:DV13 A065:DV01 A067:DV02 A068:DV08 A070:DV12,T,2018-02-10T02:05:41.000,1.1776239351011157,"[217.03..217.97GHz,564.45kHz,6.8mJy/beam@10km/s,597.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.08..219.02GHz,564.45kHz,6.8mJy/beam@10km/s,597.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.98..219.92GHz,564.45kHz,6.8mJy/beam@10km/s,597.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [219.88..220.82GHz,564.45kHz,6.8mJy/beam@10km/s,597.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.50002911710072,766.2481765874415,"Kauffmann, Jens",The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) Project for the ALMA Science Archive,"Massardi, M.",T,2021PASP..133h5001M,Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (5-4)

This will allow us to probe the dust continuum on the smallest achievable spatial scales, which will reveal any potential fragmentation and clustering and allow us to associate individual fragments with a corresponding maser detection.",G0.38+0._a_03_TM1,"Longmore, Steven; Walsh, Andrew; Pillai, Thushara; Ginsburg, Adam;",2.5243047345889034,0.06629491972310456,1.5428436994552612,uid://A001/X88e/X1e5,uid://A001/X88e/X1e6,uid://A002/Xc4b006/X308a,Linking high-mass star formation and SiO maser emission -- the Galactic centre dust-ridge cloud G0.38+0.04,S,CHECK WVR,F,1.5851491333184853,58593750.0,A007:DV09 A015:DA61 A027:DV06 A074:DA47 A087:DV25 A090:DV24 A091:DA45 A092:DV14 A093:DV20 A094:DV19 A096:PM01 A101:DA62 A102:DV03 A104:DA58 A105:DV02 A108:DA50 A110:DA41 A111:PM02 A115:DA43 A116:DV07 A118:DV01 A120:DA44 A121:DA55 A122:DV11 A123:DA42 A124:DA51 A126:DV10 A127:DA49 A128:DV13 A129:DA46 A130:DV15 A131:PM03 A132:DV23 A133:PM04 A135:DA57 P401:DA65 P404:DV16 P409:DV04 P410:DA64 S301:DA60 S303:DA63 S307:DV05 S309:DA56 W202:DA54 W207:DV17 W209:DA48 W210:DV22,F,2019-01-08T21:39:32.000,0.0682897302802213,"[84.53..84.59GHz,122.07kHz,2.6mJy/beam@10km/s,561uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [85.10..85.16GHz,122.07kHz,2.5mJy/beam@10km/s,561.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [85.13..85.18GHz,122.07kHz,2.5mJy/beam@10km/s,561.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [85.60..85.66GHz,122.07kHz,2.5mJy/beam@10km/s,561.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [85.72..85.78GHz,122.07kHz,2.5mJy/beam@10km/s,561.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.05..86.11GHz,122.07kHz,2.5mJy/beam@10km/s,561.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.20..86.26GHz,122.07kHz,2.5mJy/beam@10km/s,561.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.81..86.86GHz,122.07kHz,2.5mJy/beam@10km/s,561.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [96.30..98.17GHz,1128.91kHz,2.4mJy/beam@10km/s,99.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [98.05..99.92GHz,1128.91kHz,2.4mJy/beam@10km/s,99.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",86.83526417678672,421.32397041869666,"Walker, Daniel",,,T,,"High-mass star formation, Astrochemistry",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (2-1)

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*.

However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*. (3) Fit the inflow kinematics to constrain theoretical models for their dynamics and fates.",cnd_cs54_b_06_7M,"Wang, Hsiang-Hsu; Tang, Ya-Wen; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick; Harada, Nanase; Kim, Woong-Tae;",59.2522702643279,1.7911225375067916,1.7999999523162842,uid://A001/X1284/X16ef,uid://A001/X1284/X16f2,uid://A002/Xc5d6d1/X4981,Replenishing Molecular Gas Near the Supermassive Black Hole SgrA*,S,TARGET,T,25.797329685643618,2000000000.0,J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2019-07-04T00:00:00.000,3.7064584198286985,"[242.50..244.50GHz,1938.48kHz,56.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [244.00..246.00GHz,1128.91kHz,51.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [257.50..259.50GHz,1128.91kHz,54.7mJy/beam@10km/s,3.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [259.39..261.39GHz,1128.91kHz,59.3mJy/beam@10km/s,3.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",260.39206752838095,1304.794440616385,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA.

These gas streams are on eccentric orbits that pass by the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential well at Sgr A*. Initial investigation suggests that pericenter passage by Sgr A* may induce tidally-driven compression of clouds and subsequent star formation further downstream. This new mode of cloud collapse could give us an absolute timeline for star formation, with t= 0 occurring at pericenter passage on the streams, a fourth dimension for studies of star formation. We propose to obtain maps of the most structured cloud approaching pericenter. We outline three testable predictions of the tidally-driven cloud collapse scenario, which precludes current active star formation in the cloud. The countervailing scenarios predict none of these signatures, and instead predict star formation activity.

It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions.

This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds. The observations requested here will constitute the most comprehensive survey of CMZ molecular clouds yet.

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array observations of the candidate jet-ISM interaction zones near the black hole X-ray binaries GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942. Using these data, we map the molecular line emission in the regions, detecting emission from the HCN [J = 1-0], HCO<SUP>+</SUP> [J = 1-0], SiO [J = 2-1], CS [J = 2-1], <SUP>13</SUP>CO [J = 1-0], C<SUP>18</SUP>O [J = 1-0], HNCO [J = 4<SUB>0,4</SUB>-3<SUB>0,3</SUB>], HNCO [J = 5<SUB>0,5</SUB>-4<SUB>0,4</SUB>], and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH [J = 2<SUB>1,1</SUB>-1<SUB>1,0</SUB>] molecular transitions. Through examining the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of this emission, we identify molecular structures that may trace jet-driven cavities in the gas surrounding these systems. Our results from the GRS 1758-258 region in particular, are consistent with recent work, which postulated the presence of a jet-blown cocoon structure in deep radio continuum maps of the region. Using these newly discovered molecular structures as calorimeters, we estimate the time averaged jet power from these systems, finding $(1.1{\!-\!}5.7)\times 10^{36}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.12-0.31 Myr for GRS 1758-258 and $(0.7{\!-\!}3.5)\times 10^{37}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.10-0.26 Myr for 1E 1740.7-2942. Additionally, the spectral line characteristics of the detected emission place these molecular structures in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy, thereby constraining the distances to the black hole X-ray binaries to be 8.0 ± 1.0 kpc. Overall, our analysis solidifies the diagnostic capacity of molecular lines, and highlights how astro-chemistry can both identify jet-ISM interaction zones and probe jet feedback from Galactic X-ray binaries.",2019,"Relativistic jets launched from accreting black holes carry large amounts of energy and matter into their surrounding environment. Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), the stellar-mass analogues of active galactic nuclei (AGN), are ideal targets for studying the interactions between the jet and the ambient ISM in detail, due to their close proximity and the rapid timescale evolution of BHXB jets. Identifying and probing the ISM properties in interaction zones provides insight into highly sought-after jet properties, such as the total jet power, composition, duty cycles, and the efficiency of jet feedback. We propose targeting the candidate interaction sites around the BHXBs, GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942, with Band 3 ALMA ACA observations. We will map the CO, SiO, CS, HCO+, HCN, and HNCO line emission over 4.5 square arcmin for each target (our targets are within 5 deg, and can thus be observed in a single execution). As these lines provide for excellent diagnostics of shock energetics and ISM excitation, we can definitively test whether these candidate zones are powered by a BHXB jet, and, if the association is confirmed, measure the injected jet power through calorimetry.",GRS_1758_b_03_7M,"Miller-Jones, James; Rosolowsky, Erik; Sivakoff, Gregory;",37.545113957332916,1.1854713505005698,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X1284/X1962,uid://A001/X1284/X1963,uid://A002/Xc64412/X2db0,Mapping Jet-ISM Interactions in X-ray Binaries,S,TARGET,T,76.34646755536733,250000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2019-07-11T00:00:00.000,11.695713052909516,"[86.72..86.97GHz,282.23kHz,37.5mJy/beam@10km/s,4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.80..88.05GHz,282.23kHz,37.3mJy/beam@10km/s,4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.57..88.69GHz,282.23kHz,37.8mJy/beam@10km/s,5.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [89.13..89.25GHz,282.23kHz,38.3mJy/beam@10km/s,5.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.73..98.23GHz,282.23kHz,37.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.01..101.00GHz,31250.00kHz,37.7mJy/beam@10km/s,1.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",86.84697620665133,865.76908099605,"Tetarenko, Alexandra",ALMACAL - VI.

The maser spots are not spatially or kinematically coincident with any other masers in this region, or with the peaks of the radio continuum emission from the numerous ultracompact and hypercompact H II regions in this area. While the (2,2) maser spots are spatially unresolved in our highest-resolution observations, they have unusually broad line widths of several kilometers per second, which suggests that each of these spots consists of multiple masers tracing unresolved velocity structure.

We propose ALMA long-baseline observations to identify these structures and determine their masses and kinematic properties.

The CND, being the final place of the molecular reservoir in the Galactic center (GC), is critical to our understanding of the feeding of SgrA*. Additionally, knowing the life time of the CND is paramount. Two key factors control this life time: (1) the tidal threshold by SgrA* exerted on the gas, and (2) replenishment from exterior gas inflows. Earlier low-resolution (beam > 24) data suggest that the CND is transient because of its low density. High-resolution (0.1 pc) data are awaited to confirm this. We found a molecular streamer, originating from the ambient clouds with progressively higher velocities as it approaches the CND, in our CS(2-1) map (beam=40"" (1.5 pc)). This shows evidence of gas replenishment onto the CND. This rises the question whether the streamer consists of dense cores that are able to resist tidal disruption.

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF). This is largely due to the lack of clear--cut examples of dense clumps that are bound to form stars but have not done so yet (high--mass starless clumps: HMSCs). While scattered, small sky patch searches have been made, no systematic galaxy wide survey that can place such searches on a statistical firm footing has ever been conducted. We have now performed a systematic search for HMSCs from the ATLASGAL 870mu survey that covers the entire inner Galactic plane which are dense and devoid of infrared sources up to 70mum.

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores.

The CND consists of several molecular cores with sizes of 0.1 pc. The CND, being the final place of the molecular reservoir in the Galactic center (GC), is critical to our understanding of the feeding of SgrA*. Additionally, knowing the life time of the CND is paramount. Two key factors control this life time: (1) the tidal threshold by SgrA* exerted on the gas, and (2) replenishment from exterior gas inflows. Earlier low-resolution (beam > 24) data suggest that the CND is transient because of its low density. High-resolution (0.1 pc) data are awaited to confirm this. We found a molecular streamer, originating from the ambient clouds with progressively higher velocities as it approaches the CND, in our CS(2-1) map (beam=40"" (1.5 pc)). This shows evidence of gas replenishment onto the CND. This rises the question whether the streamer consists of dense cores that are able to resist tidal disruption. We propose to obtain a 0.1 parsec resolution map to resolve the dense cores feeding the GC along the streamer and its parent cloud with various density tracers.",gc_b_1_03_TM1,"Hwang, Chorng-Yuan; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick;",6.273657629607299,0.20483916450802073,1.2787402868270874,uid://A001/X899/Xc4,uid://A001/X899/Xc5,uid://A002/Xbb54fa/X260,Is the Molecular Inflow in the Galactic Center Transient?,S,TARGET,T,13.833575600272225,937500000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A006:DV15 A009:DV18 A010:DV23 A015:DA61 A027:DA56 A029:DA60 A034:DA46 A045:DV16 A047:DA62 A054:DV19 A060:DV06 A061:DA44 A062:DV14 A064:DV13 A065:DV01 A067:DV02 A068:DV08 A069:DA55 A070:DV12 A071:DA48 A073:DA42 A074:DV09 A075:DV24 A076:DA54 A077:DA52 A078:DV05 A079:DA64 A080:DA50 A081:DA53 A084:DV07 A085:DA47 A086:DV11 A087:DV10 A089:DA58 A090:DV04 A091:DA63 A092:DV17,T,2018-03-15T08:07:39.000,1.2469311396441238,"[86.38..87.32GHz,488.28kHz,6.3mJy/beam@10km/s,348.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.51..98.45GHz,488.28kHz,5.9mJy/beam@10km/s,349.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.61..100.55GHz,488.28kHz,6.2mJy/beam@10km/s,367uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",86.84696476478679,1469.5849482626559,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",,,T,,Galactic centres/nuclei,Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (2-1)

We identify 43 protostellar outflows, including 37 highly likely ones and 6 candidates. The outflows are found toward both known high-mass star-forming cores and less massive, seemingly quiescent cores, while 791 out of the 834 cores identified based on the continuum do not have detected outflows. The outflow masses range from less than 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to a few tens of M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with typical uncertainties of a factor of 70. We do not find evidence of disagreement between relative molecular abundances in these outflows and in nearby analogs such as the well-studied L1157 and NGC 7538S outflows. The results suggest that (i) protostellar accretion disks driving outflows ubiquitously exist in the CMZ environment, (ii) the large fraction of candidate starless cores is expected if these clouds are at very early evolutionary phases, with a caveat on the potential incompleteness of the outflows, (iii) high-mass and low-mass star formation is ongoing simultaneously in these clouds, and (iv) current data do not show evidence of a difference between the shock chemistry in the outflows that determines the molecular abundances in the CMZ environment and in nearby clouds.

We identify 43 protostellar outflows, including 37 highly likely ones and 6 candidates. The outflows are found toward both known high-mass star-forming cores and less massive, seemingly quiescent cores, while 791 out of the 834 cores identified based on the continuum do not have detected outflows. The outflow masses range from less than 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to a few tens of M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with typical uncertainties of a factor of 70. We do not find evidence of disagreement between relative molecular abundances in these outflows and in nearby analogs such as the well-studied L1157 and NGC 7538S outflows. The results suggest that (i) protostellar accretion disks driving outflows ubiquitously exist in the CMZ environment, (ii) the large fraction of candidate starless cores is expected if these clouds are at very early evolutionary phases, with a caveat on the potential incompleteness of the outflows, (iii) high-mass and low-mass star formation is ongoing simultaneously in these clouds, and (iv) current data do not show evidence of a difference between the shock chemistry in the outflows that determines the molecular abundances in the CMZ environment and in nearby clouds.

The four clouds exhibit different fragmentation states at the observed resolution despite having similar masses at the cloud scale (∼1-5 pc). Assuming a constant dust temperature of 20 K, we construct core mass functions of the clouds and find a slightly top-heavy shape as compared to the canonical initial mass function, but we note several significant uncertainties that may affect this result. The characteristic spatial separation between the cores as identified by the minimum spanning tree method, ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> au, and the characteristic core mass, 1-7 ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;, are consistent with predictions of thermal Jeans fragmentation. The three clouds showing fragmentation may be forming OB associations (stellar mass ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;).

It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars. These data will provide a unique test for star formation theories in such extreme regimes and allow us to place constraints on the dominant physical mechanisms governing the formation of the most massive stars.",a_sma1_a_06_TM2,"Alves, Joao; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Johnston, Katharine; Lu, Xing; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Ginsburg, Adam; Longmore, Steven; Zhang, Qizhou; Barnes, Ashley; Kauffmann, Jens; Gomez, Laura; Keto, Eric; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ho, Luis; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate; Pillai, Thushara;",0.5650319927544454,0.019726830251580015,0.9869346618652344,uid://A001/X87d/X13e,uid://A001/X87d/X141,uid://A002/Xbf9c0a/X3f08,Uncovering the Early Formation of Extremely Massive Stars,S,TARGET,T,6.652691364443373,234375000.0,A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A006:DV15 A007:DV04 A009:DV18 A010:DV23 A011:DV03 A015:DA61 A020:DV06 A021:DA44 A023:DA51 A027:DA56 A029:DA60 A034:DA46 A036:DV20 A037:DV19 A046:DA50 A047:DA62 A048:DV10 A049:DA57 A051:DA63 A053:DV14 A060:DV25 A061:DV01 A062:DV05 A063:DA45 A064:DA42 A065:DA64 A067:DV12 A068:DV13 A069:DA55 A071:DA52 A072:DA53 A073:DV22 A074:DA47 A075:DV11 A076:DV17 A077:DV24 A078:DV08 A079:DA54 A080:DV07,F,2018-05-05T04:19:52.000,0.7074153961159986,"[216.96..217.19GHz,564.45kHz,565uJy/beam@10km/s,99.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.07..218.31GHz,564.45kHz,563.9uJy/beam@10km/s,99.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.33..218.56GHz,564.45kHz,563.6uJy/beam@10km/s,99.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.61..218.85GHz,564.45kHz,563.3uJy/beam@10km/s,99.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [220.21..221.15GHz,564.45kHz,561.4uJy/beam@10km/s,49.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.53..233.40GHz,1938.48kHz,523.8uJy/beam@10km/s,33.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [234.03..235.90GHz,1938.48kHz,521.7uJy/beam@10km/s,33.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.07414825186225,765.1040195749532,"Walker, Daniel",Star formation in 'the Brick': ALMA reveals an active protocluster in the Galactic centre cloud G0.253+0.016 The initial conditions for young massive cluster formation in the Galactic Centre: convergence of large-scale gas flows,"Walker, Daniel L.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large.

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds. The observations requested here will constitute the most comprehensive survey of CMZ molecular clouds yet.

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF). This is largely due to the lack of clear--cut examples of dense clumps that are bound to form stars but have not done so yet (high--mass starless clumps: HMSCs). While scattered, small sky patch searches have been made, no systematic galaxy wide survey that can place such searches on a statistical firm footing has ever been conducted. We have now performed a systematic search for HMSCs from the ATLASGAL 870mu survey that covers the entire inner Galactic plane which are dense and devoid of infrared sources up to 70mum. Embedded star formation will manifest via outflowing, shocked, and warm gas component with little or no evidence of cold gas towards dense cores. By weeding out such masqueraders, and revealing the extent of fragmentation in all HMSCs, a feat only achievable with a survey machine like ALMA in an ambitious but highly economical <10 hrs main array time, we will for the first time reveal the truly massive starless cores. We will obtain the most robust constraints to date on whether massive starless cores exists, their lifetime and the initial conditions for HMSF.",AGAL354._a_06_7M,"Zhang, Qizhou; Mardones, Diego; Wyrowski, Friedrich; Kauffmann, Jens; Gomez, Laura; Urquhart, James; Giannetti, Andrea; Wang, Ke; Guzman-Fernandez, Andres; Leurini, Silvia; Menten, Karl;",40.857519436983914,1.2233781595292081,1.7999999523162842,uid://A001/X885/X2f6,uid://A001/X885/X2f9,uid://A002/Xc224f1/Xb0b,Galactic Census of All Massive Starless Cores within 5 kpc,S,TARGET,T,38.600515890330456,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,F,2018-08-28T13:48:23.000,5.187803894617688,"[215.96..217.96GHz,488.28kHz,40.9mJy/beam@10km/s,2.5mJy/beam@native, XX] U [217.83..219.83GHz,488.28kHz,41.3mJy/beam@10km/s,2.5mJy/beam@native, XX] U [230.19..232.19GHz,488.28kHz,39.1mJy/beam@10km/s,2.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [231.96..233.96GHz,488.28kHz,38.7mJy/beam@10km/s,2.4mJy/beam@native, XX]",216.9596017461208,631.0665806914811,"Pillai, Thushara",H II regions and high-mass starless clump candidates.

Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars. These data will provide a unique test for star formation theories in such extreme regimes and allow us to place constraints on the dominant physical mechanisms governing the formation of the most massive stars.",a_sma1_a_06_TM1,"Alves, Joao; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Johnston, Katharine; Lu, Xing; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Ginsburg, Adam; Longmore, Steven; Zhang, Qizhou; Barnes, Ashley; Kauffmann, Jens; Gomez, Laura; Keto, Eric; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ho, Luis; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate; Pillai, Thushara;",1.4344624233499919,0.0509292542419276,0.5992199778556824,uid://A001/X87d/X13e,uid://A001/X87d/X13f,uid://A002/Xc23361/X7f32,Uncovering the Early Formation of Extremely Massive Stars,S,CHECK WVR,F,1.731730053062434,234375000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A009:DV18 A015:DA61 A064:DA42 A069:DA55 A070:DA48 A071:DA52 A072:DA53 A073:DV22 A074:DA47 A075:DV11 A076:DV17 A078:DV08 A079:DA54 A081:DA43 A084:DV04 A085:DA56 A086:DV01 A087:DV25 A089:DV06 A090:DV24 A091:DA45 A092:DV14 A093:DV20 A094:DV19 A095:DV10 A096:DV09 A097:DA60 A098:DV05 A099:DA63 A100:DA65 A102:DV03 A103:DV16 A104:DA58 A105:DV02 A108:DA50 A111:PM02 A121:DV12 A124:DA51 A128:DV13 A129:DA46 A131:PM03 A132:DV23 A134:DA44 A135:DA57 T703:PM04,F,2018-09-05T16:07:12.000,0.12301604699353594,"[216.96..217.19GHz,564.45kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,252.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.07..218.31GHz,564.45kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,252.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.33..218.56GHz,564.45kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,252.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.61..218.85GHz,564.45kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,252.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [220.21..221.15GHz,564.45kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,126.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.53..233.40GHz,1938.48kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,87.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [234.03..235.90GHz,1938.48kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,87.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.07381179770994,765.2000514806881,"Walker, Daniel",Star formation in 'the Brick': ALMA reveals an active protocluster in the Galactic centre cloud G0.253+0.016 The initial conditions for young massive cluster formation in the Galactic Centre: convergence of large-scale gas flows,"Walker, Daniel L.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium.

It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds.

Aminoacetonitrile, a molecule detected in the interstellar medium only toward the star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), is considered an important prebiotic species; in particular, it is a possible precursor of the simplest amino acid glycine. To date, observations have been limited to ground state emission lines, whereas transitions from within vibrationally excited states remained undetected. <BR /> Aims: We wanted to accurately determine the energies of the low-lying vibrational states of aminoacetonitrile, which are expected to be populated in Sgr B2(N1), the main hot core of Sgr B2(N). This step is fundamental in order to properly evaluate the vibration-rotation partition function of aminoacetonitrile as well as the line strengths of the rotational transitions of its vibrationally excited states. This is necessary to derive accurate column densities and secure the identification of these transitions in astronomical spectra. <BR /> Methods: The far-infrared ro-vibrational spectrum of aminoacetonitrile has been recorded in absorption against a synchrotron source of continuum emission. Three bands, corresponding to the lowest vibrational modes of aminoacetonitrile, were observed in the frequency region below 500 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The combined analysis of ro-vibrational and pure rotational data allowed us to prepare new spectral line catalogs for all the states under investigation. We used the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA performed with ALMA to search for vibrationally excited aminoacetonitrile toward Sgr B2(N1). The astronomical spectra were analyzed under the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation. <BR /> Results: Almost 11 000 lines have been assigned during the analysis of the laboratory spectrum of aminoacetonitrile, thanks to which the vibrational energies of the v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1, v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1, and v<SUB>17</SUB> = 1 states have been determined. The whole dataset, which includes high J and K<SUB>a</SUB> transitions, is well reproduced within the experimental accuracy. Reliable spectral predictions of pure rotational lines can now be produced up to the THz region. On the basis of these spectroscopic predictions, we report the interstellar detection of aminoacetonitrile in its v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 vibrational states toward Sgr B2(N1) in addition to emission from its vibrational ground state. The intensities of the identified v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 lines are consistent with the detected v = 0 lines under LTE at a temperature of 200 K for an aminoacetonitrile column density of 1.1 × 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: This work shows the strong interplay between laboratory spectroscopy exploiting (sub)millimeter and synchrotron-based far-infrared techniques, and observational spectral surveys to detect complex organic molecules in space and quantify their abundances. <P />The list of assigned transitions is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160</A> ...(6)",2019,"ALMA has had a transformational effect on the search for complex organic molecules (COMs) in star-forming regions, pushing the limits of observable chemical complexity. Our recent detection of a branched alkyl molecule in the interstellar medium (ISM) with ALMA has opened a new domain in the structures available to the chemistry of star-forming regions, beyond simple chains. Our astrochemical model was recently expanded to include branched isomers, and indicates that branched molecules may be dominant in star-forming regions where the chemistry is of sufficient complexity. We propose to perform a direct observational test of this hypothesis, in order to determine both the degree and the manner in which chemical complexity evolves during star formation. We propose to search for n-butyl cyanide and its three branched isomers toward Sgr B2(N), the most fruitful target for new detections of COMs in the ISM. The discovery of biologically-relevant molecules in the ISM is of high scientific impact.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars.

Since the cloud is not associated with any visible energy sources capable of producing the observed fast turbulence, its nature remains unknown. Recently, an interesting hypothesis has been proposed, which claims that the broad emission comes from gas trailing from a clump gravitationally kicked by an intermediate-mass blackhole (IMBH) of 1e5 Msun. However, the follow-up observation with ALMA has raised several question on the fundamental assumptions made in the IMBH hypothesis, as it failed to detect clear signature of the hypothesized trailing gas. To address this problem, we propose to perform new multi-line imaging observations of the cloud in Bands-6 and -7. The setup of our observations allows to investigate the narrow-line quiescent gas components that have been previously missed. On the basis of the rich information on the cloud's kinematics, physical conditions, and chemistry provided by this observation, we will attempt to re-examine the IMBH hypothesis and to explore an alternative hypothesis in terms of cloud-cloud collision.",CO-0.40-_a_06_7M,"Nagai, Makoto; Kamegai, Kazuhisa;",22.031958814389114,0.858784170801344,1.7999999523162842,uid://A001/X1290/X2a,uid://A001/X1290/X2d,uid://A002/Xc72427/X3adc,Dense Gas associated with the Claimed Intermediate-mass Blackhole Object CO-0.40,S,TARGET,T,31.466602807705044,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2020-03-06T00:00:00.000,4.354053425359132,"[216.04..218.04GHz,1128.91kHz,22mJy/beam@10km/s,1.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.14..218.39GHz,564.45kHz,22.4mJy/beam@10km/s,3.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.39..218.64GHz,564.45kHz,21.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.68..218.93GHz,564.45kHz,20.3mJy/beam@10km/s,3.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [219.10..220.10GHz,564.45kHz,20.3mJy/beam@10km/s,1.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [219.94..220.94GHz,564.45kHz,24.2mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.04344575293783,765.7907836382655,"Tanaka, Kunihiko",,,T,,Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (5-4)

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*. (3) Fit the inflow kinematics to constrain theoretical models for their dynamics and fates.",cnd_cs54_c_06_TP,"Wang, Hsiang-Hsu; Tang, Ya-Wen; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick; Harada, Nanase; Kim, Woong-Tae;",10.334215588988432,0.3153301360729707,1.782606840133667,uid://A001/X1284/X16e5,uid://A001/X12a3/X146,uid://A002/Xc9831a/X6d48,Replenishing Molecular Gas Near the Supermassive Black Hole SgrA*,S,TARGET,T,369.7911026732289,2000000000.0,T701:PM02 T702:PM03 T703:PM01 T704:PM04,F,2019-03-21T22:30:53.000,20.862094203072512,"[242.50..244.50GHz,1938.48kHz,10.2mJy/beam@10km/s,649uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [244.00..246.00GHz,1128.91kHz,8.8mJy/beam@10km/s,565.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [257.50..259.50GHz,1128.91kHz,9.8mJy/beam@10km/s,645.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [259.39..261.39GHz,1128.91kHz,10.3mJy/beam@10km/s,681uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",260.39064972245285,1304.5637717014104,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars.

Since the cloud is not associated with any visible energy sources capable of producing the observed fast turbulence, its nature remains unknown. Recently, an interesting hypothesis has been proposed, which claims that the broad emission comes from gas trailing from a clump gravitationally kicked by an intermediate-mass blackhole (IMBH) of 1e5 Msun. However, the follow-up observation with ALMA has raised several question on the fundamental assumptions made in the IMBH hypothesis, as it failed to detect clear signature of the hypothesized trailing gas. To address this problem, we propose to perform new multi-line imaging observations of the cloud in Bands-6 and -7. The setup of our observations allows to investigate the narrow-line quiescent gas components that have been previously missed.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales.

Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation.

Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*. (3) Fit the inflow kinematics to constrain theoretical models for their dynamics and fates.",cnd_cs54_b_06_TM1,"Wang, Hsiang-Hsu; Tang, Ya-Wen; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick; Harada, Nanase; Kim, Woong-Tae;",8.217214967324352,0.2901412599442854,1.7705885171890259,uid://A001/X1284/X16ef,uid://A001/X1284/X16f0,uid://A002/Xcb1740/X57af,Replenishing Molecular Gas Near the Supermassive Black Hole SgrA*,S,TARGET,T,5.323664320878996,1875000000.0,A001:DV07 A002:DA46 A007:DV05 A008:DA42 A010:DA50 A015:DA64 A016:DA44 A022:DV23 A023:DA41 A024:DA49 A025:DV02 A027:DV06 A033:DA53 A034:DA55 A035:DA47 A036:DA45 A040:DA51 A043:DA60 A044:DV11 A047:DV15 A048:DA62 A049:DV03 A058:DA43 A060:DV17 A062:DV10 A068:DA65 A069:DV16 A070:DV22 A072:DV20 A073:DA54 A074:DV09 A075:DA52 A076:DA59 A082:DV24 A083:DA48 A085:DA63 A086:DV12 A088:DV04 A089:DA61 A090:DA56 A091:DA58 A093:DA57 A094:DV19,T,2019-12-22T00:00:00.000,0.40828569330454617,"[242.56..244.44GHz,1938.48kHz,9.2mJy/beam@10km/s,604uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [244.06..245.94GHz,1128.91kHz,9.2mJy/beam@10km/s,604.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [257.56..259.44GHz,1128.91kHz,8.2mJy/beam@10km/s,558.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [259.45..261.33GHz,1128.91kHz,8.2mJy/beam@10km/s,559.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",260.3905104580821,1304.2523107653094,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"Shocked gas is often observed in the inner 400 pc of gas rich galactic nuclei. Our Galactic center provides a unique opportunity to study shocked gas in molecular clouds at sub-parsec scales. We propose to study a compact molecular cloud, M0.10-0.08, which has elevated emission in several 3 mm shock tracers (e.g., SiO, HCN) in single-dish observations (Mills & Battersby 2017). However, the source of the shocked emission is up for debate. M0.10-0.08 is located near two possible mechanisms for this shock activity: an interaction between an expanding bubble and a gas stream (Butterfield et al. 2018) or a gravitational tidal compression (Kruijssen et al. 2015). The low-resolution of the single-dish observations are unable to determine the morphological structure of the shocked gas. Our proposed ALMA observations will be able to determine the location and kinematics of the shocked emission and determine which mechanism is producing the shocked gas in this cloud.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"We aim to map a cluster of massive, dense cores identified in the highly turbulent 1.6deg cloud, thought to be just entering the extreme environment at the center of the Milky Way: the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; inner ~300 pc of the Galaxy). While enormous effort in recent years has gone into the studying the gas and star formation properties of the inner CMZ of our Galaxy, we understand relatively little about the physical properties, kinematics, and star formation of the gas entering the Galactic Center.The discovery of massive, dense cores in the 1.6deg cloud with the large SMA survey of the CMZ (CMZoom) presents a unique opportunity to better understand the nature of the gas that flows into the center of the Galaxy as well as the star formation in this extreme environment.

We propose ALMA long-baseline observations to identify these structures and determine their masses and kinematic properties.

In the higher-resolution data NH<SUB>3</SUB> (2,2) maser emission is detected toward five independent spots. The maser spots are not spatially or kinematically coincident with any other masers in this region, or with the peaks of the radio continuum emission from the numerous ultracompact and hypercompact H II regions in this area. While the (2,2) maser spots are spatially unresolved in our highest-resolution observations, they have unusually broad line widths of several kilometers per second, which suggests that each of these spots consists of multiple masers tracing unresolved velocity structure. No other NH<SUB>3</SUB> lines observed in Sgr B2 Main are seen to be masers, which continues to challenge existing models of NH<SUB>3</SUB> maser emission.",2018,"Sgr B2 is the densest region of star formation in the Galaxy, and it is therefore the most likely to form the most massive stars in the local universe. Such proto-very massive stars (proto-VMS) may accrete from significantly different structures than the ordered disks we are accustomed to observing around nearby low-mass stars. We propose ALMA long-baseline observations to identify these structures and determine their masses and kinematic properties. We will determine whether the most massive stars, at least in our Galaxy, form by a scaled-up process similar to low-mass stars or by a more complex competitive or cooperative accretion process. We will also search for clues about whether stellar mergers are responsible for creating VMS.",sgr_b2m_a_03_TM1,"Goddi, Ciriaco; Schilke, Peter; Schmiedeke, Anika; Sanchez-Monge, Alvaro;",0.6671374380212268,0.012834813081729044,1.3446298837661743,uid://A001/X879/X15d,uid://A001/X879/X15e,uid://A002/Xc49eba/X108,(How) do very massive stars form in our Galaxy?,S,TARGET,T,1.5632418739143477,1875000000.0,A007:DV09 A015:DA61 A027:DV06 A071:DA52 A074:DA47 A090:DV24 A091:DA45 A092:DV14 A093:DV20 A094:DV19 A096:PM01 A101:DA62 A102:DV03 A104:DA58 A108:DA50 A110:DA41 A111:PM02 A115:DA43 A116:DV07 A118:DV01 A120:DA44 A121:DA55 A122:DV11 A123:DA42 A124:DA51 A126:DV10 A127:DA49 A129:DA46 A130:DV15 A131:PM03 A132:DV23 A133:PM04 A135:DA57 P401:DA65 P404:DV16 P410:DA64 S301:DA60 S303:DA63 S307:DV05 W202:DA54 W207:DV17 W209:DA48 W210:DV22,T,2019-10-18T00:00:00.000,0.0824778683804676,"[84.54..86.42GHz,1128.91kHz,674.3uJy/beam@10km/s,26.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.44..88.31GHz,1128.91kHz,667.1uJy/beam@10km/s,26.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [96.49..98.36GHz,1128.91kHz,602.4uJy/beam@10km/s,25.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [98.49..100.36GHz,1128.91kHz,596.6uJy/beam@10km/s,25.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",87.37540429691899,3436.50712540598,"Ginsburg, Adam","Discovery of <SUP>14</SUP>NH<SUB>3</SUB> (2,2) Maser Emission in Sgr B2 Main","Mills, E.

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds. The observations requested here will constitute the most comprehensive survey of CMZ molecular clouds yet. This economic project (4 hours of main array time) will greatly help to lead CMZ research towards work on more representative cloud samples.",20kms_b_06_7M,"Zhang, Qizhou; Goldsmith, Paul; Lu, Xing; Immer, Katharina; Menten, Karl; Lis, Dariusz; Pillai, Thushara; Ginsburg, Adam;",36.6360235588714,1.5064488386418975,1.7999999523162842,uid://A001/X88f/X125,uid://A001/X88f/X128,uid://A002/Xb8fee5/X2b1,"Formation, State, and Structure of all Major CMZ Clouds",S,TARGET,T,39.66479009690252,1000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2019-05-10T00:00:00.000,4.866931755806995,"[217.00..218.00GHz,564.45kHz,36.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.05..219.05GHz,564.45kHz,36.3mJy/beam@10km/s,3.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.95..219.95GHz,564.45kHz,33.2mJy/beam@10km/s,2.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [219.85..220.85GHz,564.45kHz,35.2mJy/beam@10km/s,3mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.5000335675107,766.2489548388421,"Kauffmann, Jens",The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) Project for the ALMA Science Archive,"Massardi, M.",T,2021PASP..133h5001M,Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (5-4)

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) around the Galactic center is a unique star forming environment with extreme physical conditions. How the low-mass stars in clusters in the CMZ are formed has been unknown. In previous ALMA 1.3 mm contiuum data, we identified hundreds of faint compact sources at 2000 AU scales in three massive protoclusters in the CMZ. Assuming thermal dust emission, these sources may represent a large population of low-mass protostars that are expected from the canonical initial mass function. However, the alternative possibility that they are a mix of non-thermal and thermal free-free emission cannot be ruled out. Here we propose to use ALMA to map 3 mm lines and continuum emission, to obtain spatial distributions of dense gas and estimate spectral indices of the sources, in order to assess their nature. If the majority of the compact sources are associated with dense gas and are dust emission, this will be the first time we detect clutered low-mass star formation around the Galactic center, and will be a unique oppoturnity to examine if (low-mass) star formation in the extreme environments of the CMZ can be described by the canonical IMF.",the_20_k_a_03_TM2,"Zhang, Qizhou; Longmore, Steven; Kauffmann, Jens; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Kruijssen, Diederik; Pillai, Thushara; Battersby, Cara; Ginsburg, Adam;",1.5125384346881652,0.03351466026100216,0.7434027194976807,uid://A001/X1382/X2a,uid://A001/X1382/X2d,uid://A002/Xd5c881/X686d,Are they low-mass protostars?

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) around the Galactic center is a unique star forming environment with extreme physical conditions. How the low-mass stars in clusters in the CMZ are formed has been unknown. In previous ALMA 1.3 mm contiuum data, we identified hundreds of faint compact sources at 2000 AU scales in three massive protoclusters in the CMZ. Assuming thermal dust emission, these sources may represent a large population of low-mass protostars that are expected from the canonical initial mass function. However, the alternative possibility that they are a mix of non-thermal and thermal free-free emission cannot be ruled out. Here we propose to use ALMA to map 3 mm lines and continuum emission, to obtain spatial distributions of dense gas and estimate spectral indices of the sources, in order to assess their nature. If the majority of the compact sources are associated with dense gas and are dust emission, this will be the first time we detect clutered low-mass star formation around the Galactic center, and will be a unique oppoturnity to examine if (low-mass) star formation in the extreme environments of the CMZ can be described by the canonical IMF.",the_20_k_a_03_TM2,"Zhang, Qizhou; Longmore, Steven; Kauffmann, Jens; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Kruijssen, Diederik; Pillai, Thushara; Battersby, Cara; Ginsburg, Adam;",1.5125383088530013,0.033514660375619156,0.7434027194976807,uid://A001/X1382/X2a,uid://A001/X1382/X2d,uid://A002/Xd5c881/X686d,Are they low-mass protostars?

Our Galactic center provides a unique opportunity to study shocked gas in molecular clouds at sub-parsec scales. We propose to study a compact molecular cloud, M0.10-0.08, which has elevated emission in several 3 mm shock tracers (e.g., SiO, HCN) in single-dish observations (Mills & Battersby 2017). However, the source of the shocked emission is up for debate. M0.10-0.08 is located near two possible mechanisms for this shock activity: an interaction between an expanding bubble and a gas stream (Butterfield et al. 2018) or a gravitational tidal compression (Kruijssen et al. 2015). The low-resolution of the single-dish observations are unable to determine the morphological structure of the shocked gas. Our proposed ALMA observations will be able to determine the location and kinematics of the shocked emission and determine which mechanism is producing the shocked gas in this cloud.

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions.

This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds.

These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds.

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive.

Our Galactic center provides a unique opportunity to study shocked gas in molecular clouds at sub-parsec scales. We propose to study a compact molecular cloud, M0.10-0.08, which has elevated emission in several 3 mm shock tracers (e.g., SiO, HCN) in single-dish observations (Mills & Battersby 2017). However, the source of the shocked emission is up for debate. M0.10-0.08 is located near two possible mechanisms for this shock activity: an interaction between an expanding bubble and a gas stream (Butterfield et al. 2018) or a gravitational tidal compression (Kruijssen et al. 2015). The low-resolution of the single-dish observations are unable to determine the morphological structure of the shocked gas. Our proposed ALMA observations will be able to determine the location and kinematics of the shocked emission and determine which mechanism is producing the shocked gas in this cloud. By understanding the mechanisms producing shocked gas in this cloud, we will be able to better understand observations of shocked gas in external galactic nuclei.",M0.10-0._a_03_7M,"Ott, Juergen; Mills, Elisabeth; Lang, Cornelia; Battersby, Cara; Ginsburg, Adam;",13.815795647565771,0.5418734141639183,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X133d/X29b2,uid://A001/X133d/X29b7,uid://A002/Xd77a17/Xcc9,M0.10-0.08: A Local Laboratory to Study Shocked Gas in Extreme Environments,S,TARGET,T,76.84473287020113,125000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J504:CM12 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2020-01-18T01:04:05.000,11.286919148500617,"[86.26..86.39GHz,244.14kHz,14.3mJy/beam@10km/s,2.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.68..86.80GHz,244.14kHz,13.9mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.77..86.89GHz,244.14kHz,13.8mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.25..87.37GHz,244.14kHz,13.5mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.79..87.91GHz,244.14kHz,13.2mJy/beam@10km/s,2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.85..87.97GHz,244.14kHz,13.2mJy/beam@10km/s,2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.55..88.68GHz,244.14kHz,13.5mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [89.11..89.24GHz,244.14kHz,13.3mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.22..99.34GHz,244.14kHz,13.2mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.57..99.70GHz,244.14kHz,13.3mJy/beam@10km/s,2.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.93..100.18GHz,244.14kHz,13.8mJy/beam@10km/s,1.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.00..101.25GHz,244.14kHz,14.3mJy/beam@10km/s,1.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.40..101.52GHz,244.14kHz,14.4mJy/beam@10km/s,2.4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.95..102.08GHz,244.14kHz,14.1mJy/beam@10km/s,2.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",86.8314907360936,717.8688518901583,"Butterfield, Natalie",ALMACAL - VI.

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds.

In our Cycle 2 project, SPARKS, we targeted a homogenous sample of 35 objects from the most massive infrared-quiet clumps selected from the ATLASGAL survey. SPARKS has been very successful reaching its science goals: we discovered the highest mass young protostars with envelope masses up to 130 AU within 2000 AU scales, and revealed excellent candidates of high-mass prestellar cores. At the same time, SPARKS revealed very intriguing fragmentation properties: single high-mass protostars with very high core formation efficiency versus typically low-mass protostars forming clusters. It is clear that now we need to understand the origin of these extrem routes of fragmentiation, and to search for more examples of these extreme fragmentation are crucial. Since the number of the most massive infrared quiet clumps in the inner Galaxy is limited, the only possible way to search for them, is to complete and extend the sample of all infrared quiet massive clumps up to 4.5 kpc from ATLASGAL.",G008.670_a_07_7M,"Longmore, Steven; Bronfman, Leonardo; Wyrowski, Friedrich; Urquhart, James; Tan, Jonathan; Menten, Karl; Duarte Cabral, Ana; Traficante, Alessio; Henning, Thomas; Chapillon, Edwige; Beuther, Henrik; Palau, Aina; Commercon, Benoit; Peretto, Nicolas; Testi, Leonardo; Motte, Frederique; Fuller, Gary; Leurini, Silvia; Bontemps, Sylvain; Schuller, Frederic;",25.478664346843562,0.899899832573877,0.9100000262260437,uid://A001/X12a2/X238,uid://A001/X12a2/X23b,uid://A002/Xd21a3a/X1110,"Extending SPARKS: Exploring the origin of single high-mass protostars, and rich clusters",S,TARGET,T,25.45100183237481,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2020-06-24T00:00:00.000,3.341861685415567,"[333.32..335.31GHz,1128.91kHz,25.6mJy/beam@10km/s,1.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [335.19..337.19GHz,1128.91kHz,22.3mJy/beam@10km/s,1.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [345.23..347.23GHz,1128.91kHz,22.7mJy/beam@10km/s,1.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [347.07..349.07GHz,1128.91kHz,25.5mJy/beam@10km/s,1.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",348.065599994134,975.2013082754978,"Csengeri, Timea",ALMACAL - VI.

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs.

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF). This is largely due to the lack of clear--cut examples of dense clumps that are bound to form stars but have not done so yet (high--mass starless clumps: HMSCs). While scattered, small sky patch searches have been made, no systematic galaxy wide survey that can place such searches on a statistical firm footing has ever been conducted. We have now performed a systematic search for HMSCs from the ATLASGAL 870mu survey that covers the entire inner Galactic plane which are dense and devoid of infrared sources up to 70mum. Embedded star formation will manifest via outflowing, shocked, and warm gas component with little or no evidence of cold gas towards dense cores. By weeding out such masqueraders, and revealing the extent of fragmentation in all HMSCs, a feat only achievable with a survey machine like ALMA in an ambitious but highly economical <10 hrs main array time, we will for the first time reveal the truly massive starless cores. We will obtain the most robust constraints to date on whether massive starless cores exists, their lifetime and the initial conditions for HMSF.",AGAL354._a_06_TP,"Zhang, Qizhou; Mardones, Diego; Wyrowski, Friedrich; Kauffmann, Jens; Gomez, Laura; Urquhart, James; Giannetti, Andrea; Wang, Ke; Guzman-Fernandez, Andres; Leurini, Silvia; Menten, Karl;",57.016824381038504,1.710777488718715,0.4235568046569824,uid://A001/X885/X2f6,uid://A001/X885/X2fd,uid://A002/Xda845c/X4be9,Galactic Census of All Massive Starless Cores within 5 kpc,S,TARGET,T,414.14697787360006,2000000000.0,A108:PM04 A121:PM03 A126:PM01 A135:PM02 T701:PM02 T702:PM03 T703:PM01 T704:PM04,F,2021-07-27T00:00:00.000,23.364290998539225,"[215.96..217.96GHz,488.28kHz,57mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [217.83..219.83GHz,488.28kHz,57.2mJy/beam@10km/s,3.5mJy/beam@native, XX] U [230.19..232.19GHz,488.28kHz,54.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [231.96..233.96GHz,488.28kHz,54.8mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX]",216.96035890584264,630.98107560143,"Pillai, Thushara",H II regions and high-mass starless clump candidates.

In addition to the submillimeter, we utilize concurrent mid-infrared (mid-IR; Spitzer) and X-ray (Chandra) observations. The submillimeter emission lags less than δ t ≍ 30 minutes behind the mid-IR data. However, the entire submillimeter flare was not observed, raising the possibility that the time delay is a consequence of incomplete sampling of the light curve. The decay of the submillimeter emission is not consistent with synchrotron cooling. Therefore, we analyze these data adopting an adiabatically expanding synchrotron source that is initially optically thick or thin in the submillimeter, yielding time-delayed or synchronous flaring with the IR, respectively. The time-delayed model is consistent with a plasma blob of radius 0.8 R <SUB>S</SUB> (Schwarzschild radius), electron power-law index p = 3.5 (N(E) ∝ E <SUP>-p </SUP>), equipartition magnetic field of B <SUB>eq</SUB> ≍ 90 Gauss, and expansion velocity ${v}_{\exp }\approx 0.004c$ . The simultaneous emission is fit by a plasma blob of radius 2 R <SUB>S</SUB>, p = 2.5, B <SUB>eq</SUB> ≍ 27 Gauss, and ${v}_{\exp }\approx 0.014c$ . Since the submillimeter time delay is not completely unambiguous, we cannot definitively conclude which model better represents the data. This observation presents the best evidence for a unified flaring mechanism between submillimeter and X-ray wavelengths and places significant constraints on the source size and magnetic field strength. We show that concurrent observations at lower frequencies would be able to determine if the flaring emission is initially optically thick or thin in the submillimeter. We report a timing analysis of near-infrared (NIR), X-ray, and submillimeter data during a 3 day coordinated campaign observing Sagittarius A*. Data were collected at 4.5 μm with the Spitzer Space Telescope, 2-8 keV with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, 3-70 keV with NuSTAR, 340 GHz with ALMA, and 2.2 μm with the GRAVITY instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Two dates show moderate variability with no significant lags between the submillimeter and the infrared at 99% confidence. A moderately bright NIR flare (F <SUB>K</SUB> ~ 15 mJy) was captured on July 18 simultaneous with an X-ray flare (F <SUB>2-10 keV</SUB> ~ 0.1 counts s<SUP>-1</SUP>) that most likely preceded bright submillimeter flux (F <SUB>340 GHz</SUB> ~ 5.5 Jy) by about $+{34}_{-33}^{+14}$ minutes at 99% confidence. The uncertainty in this lag is dominated by the fact that we did not observe the peak of the submillimeter emission. A synchrotron source cooled through adiabatic expansion can describe a rise in the submillimeter once the synchrotron self-Compton NIR and X-ray peaks have faded. This model predicts high GHz and THz fluxes at the time of the NIR/X-ray peak and electron densities well above those implied from average accretion rates for Sgr A*. However, the higher electron density postulated in this scenario would be in agreement with the idea that 2019 was an extraordinary epoch with a heightened accretion rate. Since the NIR and X-ray peaks can also be fit by a nonthermal synchrotron source with lower electron densities, we cannot rule out an unrelated chance coincidence of this bright submillimeter flare with the NIR/X-ray emission.",2021,ALMA observatory program aiming at monitoring the submm flux of Sgr A* in coordination with space observatories.

These gas streams are on eccentric orbits that pass by the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential well at Sgr A*. Initial investigation suggests that pericenter passage by Sgr A* may induce tidally-driven compression of clouds and subsequent star formation further downstream. This new mode of cloud collapse could give us an absolute timeline for star formation, with t= 0 occurring at pericenter passage on the streams, a fourth dimension for studies of star formation. We propose to obtain maps of the most structured cloud approaching pericenter. We outline three testable predictions of the tidally-driven cloud collapse scenario, which precludes current active star formation in the cloud.

The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains.

The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_a_06_TM1,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",0.6115156206593734,0.019562768576717897,0.8229097723960876,uid://A001/X133d/X1307,uid://A001/X133d/X1308,uid://A002/Xde8105/X18c0,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,PHASE WVR,F,0.4071515061763957,1875000000.0,A058:DA41 A074:DV09 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A094:DV14 A101:DA65 A105:DA64 A108:PM04 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:PM03 A122:DA44 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A131:DV21 A132:DA57 A133:DV10 A134:DA63 A135:PM02 P403:DA45 P408:DV17 P409:DV11 P410:DV06 P411:DA56 P412:DA60 P413:DV03 S303:DV23 S305:DA62 S306:DV20 S307:DA47 S308:DV22 W201:DA50 W202:DA55 W205:DA52 W207:DV25 W208:DV13 W209:DV05,F,2020-11-19T17:01:05.000,0.02178696605125239,"[213.86..215.73GHz,1128.91kHz,688.8uJy/beam@10km/s,42.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [216.06..217.93GHz,1128.91kHz,611.5uJy/beam@10km/s,38uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [227.26..229.13GHz,1128.91kHz,599.6uJy/beam@10km/s,38.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [229.61..231.48GHz,1128.91kHz,597.2uJy/beam@10km/s,38.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",216.99746389994067,1473.954676212286,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

Our previous GBT-100m and SMA observations of molecular lines have revealed that the well-known 2-4 pc Galactic circumnuclear disk (CND) may consist of a convergence of several >2 pc scale molecular gas streams. The ionized mini-spiral arms in the inner ~1 pc radius further indicate that a portion of these molecular gas streams may penetrate inside the CND. However, the previous 22"" resolution OI line observations suggested that the ionized mini-spiral arms may be merely the ionized rim of the ~10 times more massive atomic gas streams. With this proposal, we seek to take advantage of the new CI observation capability of ALMA Band 8, to resolve these atomic gas streams at subarcsecond resolution. The aim of this proposal is to unveil detailed morphology and kinematics of the atomic accretion flows for the first time, and by using both the spatial distribution and the observed velocity field of the atomic gas, we will diagnose how it survives the ionizing flux when approaching the central OB cluster and the black hole.",SgrA_sta_a_08_TP,"Minh, Young; Longmore, Steven; Takami, Michihiro; Martin-Pintado, Jesus; Mills, Elisabeth; Harada, Nanase; Zhao, Jun-Hui; Morris, Mark; Leon, Stéphane; Matsushita, Satoki; Su, Yu-Nung; Blundell, Raymond; Ott, Juergen; Ho, Paul; Martin, Sergio; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Hsieh, Pei-Ying; Guesten, Rolf; wright, melvyn;",49.75291205644331,2.576471171221032,0.4423835277557373,uid://A001/X2d8/X39d,uid://A001/X2d8/X3a4,uid://A002/Xb66ea7/X91b3,Resolving atomic gas in the accretion flow surrounding Sgr A*,S,TARGET WVR,T,192.01386805786393,2000000000.0,T701:PM03 T703:PM04 T704:PM01,F,2019-09-14T20:18:29.000,10.832635024642224,"[477.21..479.21GHz,1938.48kHz,49.8mJy/beam@10km/s,4.4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [479.00..481.00GHz,1938.48kHz,50.9mJy/beam@10km/s,4.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [489.25..491.25GHz,1938.48kHz,82.5mJy/beam@10km/s,7.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [491.21..493.21GHz,1938.48kHz,60.1mJy/beam@10km/s,5.4mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",478.21169745993586,1183.035890772702,"Liu, Hauyu Baobab",,,F,,Galactic centres/nuclei,Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (11-10)

Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation.

Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst.

The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation.

Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) around the Galactic center is a unique star forming environment with extreme physical conditions. How the low-mass stars in clusters in the CMZ are formed has been unknown. In previous ALMA 1.3 mm contiuum data, we identified hundreds of faint compact sources at 2000 AU scales in three massive protoclusters in the CMZ. Assuming thermal dust emission, these sources may represent a large population of low-mass protostars that are expected from the canonical initial mass function. However, the alternative possibility that they are a mix of non-thermal and thermal free-free emission cannot be ruled out. Here we propose to use ALMA to map 3 mm lines and continuum emission, to obtain spatial distributions of dense gas and estimate spectral indices of the sources, in order to assess their nature. If the majority of the compact sources are associated with dense gas and are dust emission, this will be the first time we detect clutered low-mass star formation around the Galactic center, and will be a unique oppoturnity to examine if (low-mass) star formation in the extreme environments of the CMZ can be described by the canonical IMF.",SgrB1off_a_03_TM2,"Zhang, Qizhou; Longmore, Steven; Kauffmann, Jens; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Kruijssen, Diederik; Pillai, Thushara; Battersby, Cara; Ginsburg, Adam;",0.9902589452256737,0.02185771205371491,1.1440634727478027,uid://A001/X1382/X25,uid://A001/X1382/X28,uid://A002/Xd58951/Xe45b,Are they low-mass protostars?

In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars. We propose to map the ISM in 12'x12' regions around eight of these hot spots with the ACA in a number of molecular lines.

As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region G358.93-0.03. Since then, the global maser community has discovered 20 new torsionally-excited methanol maser transitions from 6 to 360 GHz toward this source(!), all likely powered by an ongoing accretion outburst in a massive protostar. SMA and ALMA DDT observations have pinpointed the deeply-embedded outbursting object, which powers a line-rich hot core and lacks a near-IR counterpart, much like NGC6334I-MM1. Measuring the lifetime of the excited masers and the rate of decline of the heated dust continuum is now critical to compare to the first two cases, which we will achieve by repeating the 400 au resolution DDT observations in Band 5 and 7. We also propose new Band 6 and 7 observations designed to disentangle the multiple outflows present in the host protocluster, and assess the energetics, and hence dynamical impact of massive protostellar episodic accretion.",G358.93_a_06_TM2,"Hirano, Naomi; MacLeod, Gordon; Chen, Xi; Chibueze, James; Menten, Karl; Sobolev, Andrey; Cyganowski, Claudia; Sugiyama, Koichiro; McGuire, Brett; Hunter, Todd; Stecklum, Bringfried; Burns, Ross;",0.9243620338971287,0.051399760255329205,0.9541271924972534,uid://A001/X1465/X248c,uid://A001/X1465/X248f,uid://A002/Xe1d2cb/X1164d,Tracking the lifetime and resolving the properties of the massive protostellar accretion outburst in G358.93-0.03,S,TARGET,T,5.428950982256529,937500000.0,A001:DA48 A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A011:DV07 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A024:DA58 A027:DV17 A033:DA49 A035:DA43 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A047:DV06 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA59 A072:DA53 A073:DV23 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A086:DV22 A087:DV18 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A093:DV03 A094:DV14,F,2021-01-10T16:55:18.000,0.4464849993942407,"[216.44..217.38GHz,488.28kHz,924.4uJy/beam@10km/s,81.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.08..218.55GHz,282.23kHz,922uJy/beam@10km/s,114.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [219.88..220.35GHz,282.23kHz,919uJy/beam@10km/s,115uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [220.33..220.80GHz,282.23kHz,918.3uJy/beam@10km/s,115uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",216.91160510870907,383.2247639020899,"Brogan, Crystal",,,T,,"Outflows, jets and ionized winds, High-mass star formation",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (5-4)

This will enable us to learn whether the formation of massive stars in the CMZ fits into the standard disk accretion model.",c20kms_c_a_06_TM1,"Zhang, Qizhou; Longmore, Steven; Kauffmann, Jens; Walker, Daniel; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Kruijssen, Diederik; Pillai, Thushara; Battersby, Cara;",0.7585619761886169,0.025870355249781343,0.7578309178352356,uid://A001/X13c5/X9b,uid://A001/X13c5/X9c,uid://A002/Xdd3de2/X3313,Evidence of accretion disks during the formation of high-mass stars in the Central Molecular Zone,S,TARGET,T,0.8232553667786945,1875000000.0,A015:DA64 A027:DV17 A042:DV08 A058:DA41 A068:DA65 A069:DV16 A074:DV09 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A086:DV22 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A092:DV12 A093:DV03 A094:DV14 A096:DA50 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A105:DA64 A108:PM04 A110:DA55 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:PM03 A122:DA44 A123:DA48 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A131:DV21 A132:DA57 A133:DV10 A134:DA63 A135:PM02 A136:DV04 P401:DA59 P403:DA45 P409:DV11 P410:DV06 P411:DA56 P412:DA60 S301:DA54 S303:DV23 S305:DA62 S306:DV20 S307:DA47 S308:DV22 S309:DA51 W201:DA50 W202:DA55 W205:DA52 W207:DV25 W208:DV13 W209:DV05 W210:DA53,F,2021-12-31T00:00:00.000,0.02425795092174276,"[216.95..218.83GHz,976.56kHz,758.6uJy/beam@10km/s,47.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [220.02..220.95GHz,488.28kHz,755uJy/beam@10km/s,66.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.15..233.02GHz,976.56kHz,767uJy/beam@10km/s,49.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [233.15..235.02GHz,976.56kHz,764.8uJy/beam@10km/s,49.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.89041237920753,662.4681267349767,"Lu, Xing",,,T,,High-mass star formation,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (5-4)

The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction.

We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains. The outflows of evolved stars are the best laboratories to answer this pivotal question due to their rich chemistry and relatively simple dynamical structure. With this Large Program we aim to establish the dominant physical and chemical processes in the winds of oxygen-rich evolved stars over a range of stellar masses, pulsation behaviours, mass-loss rates, and evolutionary phases. The goal is to unravel the phase transition from gas-phase to dust species, pinpoint the chemical pathways, map the morphological structure, and study the interplay between dynamical and chemical phenomena. The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_c_06_TM2,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",1.2807136897724116,0.04997608616652697,2.415836811065674,uid://A001/X133d/X1313,uid://A001/X133d/X1316,uid://A002/Xe07f3e/Xfff2,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,TARGET,T,2.23359806866612,1875000000.0,A007:DV21 A015:DV25 A022:DV01 A027:DV17 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA59 A072:DA53 A073:DV23 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A086:DV22 A087:DV18 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A093:DV03 A094:DV14 A096:DA50 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A110:DA55 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:DV10 A122:DA44 A123:DA48 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A132:DA57 A134:DA63 A135:PM02,F,2020-12-31T13:42:11.000,0.10771631697857263,"[244.08..245.01GHz,564.45kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,120.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.38..247.25GHz,1128.91kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,85.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [258.65..260.52GHz,1128.91kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,87uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [262.13..263.07GHz,564.45kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,126.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",259.5843641347238,645.5937074948245,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains. The outflows of evolved stars are the best laboratories to answer this pivotal question due to their rich chemistry and relatively simple dynamical structure. With this Large Program we aim to establish the dominant physical and chemical processes in the winds of oxygen-rich evolved stars over a range of stellar masses, pulsation behaviours, mass-loss rates, and evolutionary phases. The goal is to unravel the phase transition from gas-phase to dust species, pinpoint the chemical pathways, map the morphological structure, and study the interplay between dynamical and chemical phenomena. The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_c_06_TM2,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",4.049970101057877,0.15803829500897398,2.415836811065674,uid://A001/X133d/X1313,uid://A001/X133d/X1316,uid://A002/Xe07f3e/Xfff2,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,CHECK WVR,F,2.158253813476982,1875000000.0,A007:DV21 A015:DV25 A022:DV01 A027:DV17 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA59 A072:DA53 A073:DV23 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A086:DV22 A087:DV18 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A093:DV03 A094:DV14 A096:DA50 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A110:DA55 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:DV10 A122:DA44 A123:DA48 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A132:DA57 A134:DA63 A135:PM02,F,2020-12-31T13:42:11.000,0.10845757848104101,"[244.08..245.01GHz,564.45kHz,4.1mJy/beam@10km/s,381.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.38..247.25GHz,1128.91kHz,4.1mJy/beam@10km/s,270uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [258.65..260.52GHz,1128.91kHz,4mJy/beam@10km/s,275.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [262.13..263.07GHz,564.45kHz,4.1mJy/beam@10km/s,400.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",259.58476275501334,645.5937074948245,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation.

Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst. Because this outburst has been caught in a much earlier stage, we have the best opportunity yet to explore and understand the underlying mechanism.

In addition to the submillimeter, we utilize concurrent mid-infrared (mid-IR; Spitzer) and X-ray (Chandra) observations. The submillimeter emission lags less than δ t ≍ 30 minutes behind the mid-IR data. However, the entire submillimeter flare was not observed, raising the possibility that the time delay is a consequence of incomplete sampling of the light curve. The decay of the submillimeter emission is not consistent with synchrotron cooling. Therefore, we analyze these data adopting an adiabatically expanding synchrotron source that is initially optically thick or thin in the submillimeter, yielding time-delayed or synchronous flaring with the IR, respectively. The time-delayed model is consistent with a plasma blob of radius 0.8 R <SUB>S</SUB> (Schwarzschild radius), electron power-law index p = 3.5 (N(E) ∝ E <SUP>-p </SUP>), equipartition magnetic field of B <SUB>eq</SUB> ≍ 90 Gauss, and expansion velocity ${v}_{\exp }\approx 0.004c$ . The simultaneous emission is fit by a plasma blob of radius 2 R <SUB>S</SUB>, p = 2.5, B <SUB>eq</SUB> ≍ 27 Gauss, and ${v}_{\exp }\approx 0.014c$ . Since the submillimeter time delay is not completely unambiguous, we cannot definitively conclude which model better represents the data. This observation presents the best evidence for a unified flaring mechanism between submillimeter and X-ray wavelengths and places significant constraints on the source size and magnetic field strength. We show that concurrent observations at lower frequencies would be able to determine if the flaring emission is initially optically thick or thin in the submillimeter. We report a timing analysis of near-infrared (NIR), X-ray, and submillimeter data during a 3 day coordinated campaign observing Sagittarius A*. Data were collected at 4.5 μm with the Spitzer Space Telescope, 2-8 keV with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, 3-70 keV with NuSTAR, 340 GHz with ALMA, and 2.2 μm with the GRAVITY instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Two dates show moderate variability with no significant lags between the submillimeter and the infrared at 99% confidence. A moderately bright NIR flare (F <SUB>K</SUB> ~ 15 mJy) was captured on July 18 simultaneous with an X-ray flare (F <SUB>2-10 keV</SUB> ~ 0.1 counts s<SUP>-1</SUP>) that most likely preceded bright submillimeter flux (F <SUB>340 GHz</SUB> ~ 5.5 Jy) by about $+{34}_{-33}^{+14}$ minutes at 99% confidence. The uncertainty in this lag is dominated by the fact that we did not observe the peak of the submillimeter emission. A synchrotron source cooled through adiabatic expansion can describe a rise in the submillimeter once the synchrotron self-Compton NIR and X-ray peaks have faded. This model predicts high GHz and THz fluxes at the time of the NIR/X-ray peak and electron densities well above those implied from average accretion rates for Sgr A*. However, the higher electron density postulated in this scenario would be in agreement with the idea that 2019 was an extraordinary epoch with a heightened accretion rate. Since the NIR and X-ray peaks can also be fit by a nonthermal synchrotron source with lower electron densities, we cannot rule out an unrelated chance coincidence of this bright submillimeter flare with the NIR/X-ray emission.",2021,ALMA observatory program aiming at monitoring the submm flux of Sgr A* in coordination with space observatories.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars. We propose to map the ISM in 12'x12' regions around eight of these hot spots with the ACA in a number of molecular lines. These data will trace the localized impact of feedback through measuring shocks, PDRs, elevated excitation, and through a detailed dynamical analysis.",Position_e_06_7M,"Ott, Juergen; Mills, Elisabeth; Krieger, Nico; Meier, David; Ginsburg, Adam;",51.505095924250284,1.7162423936990299,1.7999999523162842,uid://A001/X142c/X188,uid://A001/X142c/X189,uid://A002/Xe07f3e/X8eaf,Localized Feedback Processes in the Galactic CMZ,S,TARGET,T,27.769630050447233,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2020-12-05T00:00:00.000,4.646087412835422,"[244.31..246.30GHz,1128.91kHz,52.2mJy/beam@10km/s,3.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.50..247.50GHz,1128.91kHz,50.2mJy/beam@10km/s,3.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [260.14..262.14GHz,1128.91kHz,51.5mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [262.00..264.00GHz,1128.91kHz,58.4mJy/beam@10km/s,3.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",261.1387877267778,1291.814245110146,"Candelaria, Tierra",,,T,,"Outflows, jets, feedback, Galactic centres/nuclei",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (6-5)

We also find that the dense cores traced by the HC3N line are located within these filamentary structures.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","Binary interactions dominate the evolution of massive stars, but their role is less clear for low- and intermediate-mass stars. The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains. The outflows of evolved stars are the best laboratories to answer this pivotal question due to their rich chemistry and relatively simple dynamical structure. With this Large Program we aim to establish the dominant physical and chemical processes in the winds of oxygen-rich evolved stars over a range of stellar masses, pulsation behaviours, mass-loss rates, and evolutionary phases. The goal is to unravel the phase transition from gas-phase to dust species, pinpoint the chemical pathways, map the morphological structure, and study the interplay between dynamical and chemical phenomena. The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_c_06_TM1,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",0.5385851595911145,0.021150755883891613,1.8631935119628906,uid://A001/X133d/X1313,uid://A001/X133d/X1314,uid://A002/Xde9c3e/X82f2,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,TARGET,T,0.534961960221998,1875000000.0,A058:DA41 A074:DV09 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A089:DV16 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A094:DV14 A096:DA50 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A105:DA64 A108:PM04 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:PM03 A122:DA44 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A131:DV21 A133:DV10 A134:DA63 A135:PM02 P403:DA45 P409:DV11 P410:DV06 P411:DA56 S303:DV23 S305:DA62 S306:DV20 S307:DA47 S308:DV22 W202:DA55 W205:DA52 W207:DV25 W208:DV13 W210:DA53,F,2020-10-30T09:45:23.000,0.02441551952164655,"[244.08..245.01GHz,564.45kHz,565.5uJy/beam@10km/s,52.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.37..247.24GHz,1128.91kHz,548.9uJy/beam@10km/s,36.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [258.67..260.55GHz,1128.91kHz,538.6uJy/beam@10km/s,36.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [262.13..263.06GHz,564.45kHz,536.4uJy/beam@10km/s,51.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",259.6102959073171,645.5564167588947,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","Binary interactions dominate the evolution of massive stars, but their role is less clear for low- and intermediate-mass stars. The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains. The outflows of evolved stars are the best laboratories to answer this pivotal question due to their rich chemistry and relatively simple dynamical structure. With this Large Program we aim to establish the dominant physical and chemical processes in the winds of oxygen-rich evolved stars over a range of stellar masses, pulsation behaviours, mass-loss rates, and evolutionary phases. The goal is to unravel the phase transition from gas-phase to dust species, pinpoint the chemical pathways, map the morphological structure, and study the interplay between dynamical and chemical phenomena. The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_c_06_TM1,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",0.9358414979959667,0.03675142154947248,1.8631935119628906,uid://A001/X133d/X1313,uid://A001/X133d/X1314,uid://A002/Xde9c3e/X82f2,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,PHASE WVR,F,0.5297929303068762,1875000000.0,A058:DA41 A074:DV09 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A089:DV16 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A094:DV14 A096:DA50 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A105:DA64 A108:PM04 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:PM03 A122:DA44 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A131:DV21 A133:DV10 A134:DA63 A135:PM02 P403:DA45 P409:DV11 P410:DV06 P411:DA56 S303:DV23 S305:DA62 S306:DV20 S307:DA47 S308:DV22 W202:DA55 W205:DA52 W207:DV25 W208:DV13 W210:DA53,F,2020-10-30T09:45:23.000,0.024424807283475968,"[244.08..245.01GHz,564.45kHz,982.5uJy/beam@10km/s,91.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.37..247.24GHz,1128.91kHz,953.7uJy/beam@10km/s,63.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [258.67..260.55GHz,1128.91kHz,935.8uJy/beam@10km/s,63.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [262.13..263.07GHz,564.45kHz,932.1uJy/beam@10km/s,90.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",259.6106995977997,645.5564167588947,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

These gas streams are on eccentric orbits that pass by the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential well at Sgr A*. Initial investigation suggests that pericenter passage by Sgr A* may induce tidally-driven compression of clouds and subsequent star formation further downstream. This new mode of cloud collapse could give us an absolute timeline for star formation, with t= 0 occurring at pericenter passage on the streams, a fourth dimension for studies of star formation. We propose to obtain maps of the most structured cloud approaching pericenter. We outline three testable predictions of the tidally-driven cloud collapse scenario, which precludes current active star formation in the cloud. The countervailing scenarios predict none of these signatures, and instead predict star formation activity. We will perform the first detailed observational test of cloud collapse by tidal compression where the influence of the tidal field is the strongest.",Stone_Cl_a_06_TM1,"Longmore, Steven; Zhang, Qizhou; Walker, Daniel; Kauffmann, Jens; Klessen, Ralf; Mills, Elisabeth; Keto, Eric; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Tolls, Volker; Ho, Luis; Lu, Xing; Rathborne, Jill; Glover, Simon; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Pillai, Thushara; Ginsburg, Adam;",7.125380320286877,0.24494382322346325,2.677177906036377,uid://A001/X892/X7,uid://A001/X892/X8,uid://A002/Xbdcd3c/X21bd,Testing a New Mode for Cloud Collapse in Galaxy Centers,S,TARGET,T,12.606562974163003,117187500.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A003:DV22 A004:DA41 A005:DA43 A006:DV15 A007:DV04 A008:DV07 A009:DV18 A010:DV23 A011:DV03 A013:DA53 A014:DV17 A015:DA61 A016:DV13 A017:DV24 A018:DV09 A019:DA42 A020:DV06 A021:DA44 A022:DA48 A023:DA51 A024:DA64 A025:DA52 A026:DA54 A027:DA56 A029:DA60 A030:DV16 A034:DA46 A035:DA65 A037:DV19 A039:DA58 A040:DV25 A041:DA63 A042:DV05 A043:DV08 A044:DV12 A045:DV01 A046:DA50 A047:DA62 A048:DV10 A049:DA57 A050:DV14 A064:DV13 A067:DV02 A069:DA55 A075:DV11,T,2018-04-22T01:02:22.000,1.307728907835366,"[217.01..217.13GHz,244.14kHz,7.1mJy/beam@10km/s,1.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.13..218.24GHz,244.14kHz,7.1mJy/beam@10km/s,1.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.38..218.50GHz,244.14kHz,7.1mJy/beam@10km/s,1.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.66..218.78GHz,244.14kHz,7.1mJy/beam@10km/s,1.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.93..220.81GHz,1128.91kHz,7mJy/beam@10km/s,437.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.06..232.94GHz,1128.91kHz,6.9mJy/beam@10km/s,440.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [232.82..234.70GHz,1128.91kHz,6.9mJy/beam@10km/s,446uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.06869286281395,334.4963645257708,"Battersby, Cara",,,T,,"High-mass star formation, Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,ari_l,SiO (5-4)

The three SiO (5-4) clumps closest to Sgr A* show the largest central velocities, ~150 km s–1, and the broadest asymmetric line widths with full width zero intensity (FWZI) ~110-147 km s–1. The remaining clumps, distributed mainly to the NE of the ionized mini-spiral, have narrow FWZI (~18-56 km s–1). Using CARMA SiO (2-1) data, Large Velocity Gradient modeling of the SiO line ratios for the broad velocity clumps constrains the column density N(SiO) ~1014 cm–2, and the H2 gas density n_H_2=(3{--}9)\times 10^5 cm–3 for an assumed kinetic temperature 100-200 K. The SiO clumps are interpreted as highly embedded protostellar outflows, signifying an early stage of massive star formation near Sgr A* in the last 104-105 yr. Support for this interpretation is provided by the SiO (5-4) line luminosities and velocity widths which lie in the range measured for protostellar outflows in star-forming regions in the Galaxy. Furthermore, spectral energy distribution modeling of stellar sources shows two young stellar object candidates near SiO clumps, supporting in situ star formation near Sgr A*. We discuss the nature of star formation where the gravitational potential of the black hole dominates. In particular, we suggest that external radiative pressure exerted on self-shielded molecular clouds enhances the gas density, before the gas cloud becomes gravitationally unstable near Sgr A*. Alternatively, collisions between clumps in the ring may trigger gravitational collapse. We present radio and infrared observations indicating ongoing star formation activity inside the ∼2–5 pc circumnuclear ring at the Galactic center. Collectively these measurements suggest a continued disk-based mode of ongoing star formation has taken place near Sgr A* over the last few million years. First, Very Large Array observations with spatial resolution 2.″17 × 0.″81 reveal 13 water masers, several of which have multiple velocity components.

The three SiO (5-4) clumps closest to Sgr A* show the largest central velocities, ~150 km s–1, and the broadest asymmetric line widths with full width zero intensity (FWZI) ~110-147 km s–1. The remaining clumps, distributed mainly to the NE of the ionized mini-spiral, have narrow FWZI (~18-56 km s–1). Using CARMA SiO (2-1) data, Large Velocity Gradient modeling of the SiO line ratios for the broad velocity clumps constrains the column density N(SiO) ~1014 cm–2, and the H2 gas density n_H_2=(3{--}9)\times 10^5 cm–3 for an assumed kinetic temperature 100-200 K. The SiO clumps are interpreted as highly embedded protostellar outflows, signifying an early stage of massive star formation near Sgr A* in the last 104-105 yr. Support for this interpretation is provided by the SiO (5-4) line luminosities and velocity widths which lie in the range measured for protostellar outflows in star-forming regions in the Galaxy. Furthermore, spectral energy distribution modeling of stellar sources shows two young stellar object candidates near SiO clumps, supporting in situ star formation near Sgr A*. We discuss the nature of star formation where the gravitational potential of the black hole dominates. In particular, we suggest that external radiative pressure exerted on self-shielded molecular clouds enhances the gas density, before the gas cloud becomes gravitationally unstable near Sgr A*. Alternatively, collisions between clumps in the ring may trigger gravitational collapse. We present radio and infrared observations indicating ongoing star formation activity inside the ∼2–5 pc circumnuclear ring at the Galactic center. Collectively these measurements suggest a continued disk-based mode of ongoing star formation has taken place near Sgr A* over the last few million years. First, Very Large Array observations with spatial resolution 2.″17 × 0.″81 reveal 13 water masers, several of which have multiple velocity components. The presence of interstellar water masers suggests gas densities that are sufficient for self-gravity to overcome the tidal shear of the 4× {10}6 {M}ȯ black hole.

It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds. The observations requested here will constitute the most comprehensive survey of CMZ molecular clouds yet.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*.

As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region G358.93-0.03. Since then, the global maser community has discovered 20 new torsionally-excited methanol maser transitions from 6 to 360 GHz toward this source(!), all likely powered by an ongoing accretion outburst in a massive protostar. SMA and ALMA DDT observations have pinpointed the deeply-embedded outbursting object, which powers a line-rich hot core and lacks a near-IR counterpart, much like NGC6334I-MM1. Measuring the lifetime of the excited masers and the rate of decline of the heated dust continuum is now critical to compare to the first two cases, which we will achieve by repeating the 400 au resolution DDT observations in Band 5 and 7.

CO-0.4 is a newly-discovered candidate site of an on-going CCC event; ALMA observations have revealed two distinct velocity components bridged by broad emissions of SiO 5-4 line, which is a classical signpost of CCC. We have also discovered a few bright peaks of DCN or COM species in the midst of the fast turbulence in the CCC interface; preliminary analysis shows that several of them may have very high density (10^7 cm-3), relatively narrow velocity width (2 km/s), and possibly a low virial parameter of 1-10. For cycle-7, we propose a follow-up observation to measure accurate values of their masses, virial parameters, and volume density distribution on the basis of excitation analysis with multi-transition CS, SiO, and HCN lines. If these peaks are confirmed to be self-gravitating cores that are capable of star-formation, we may be able to firstly capture the onset of CCC-triggered star-formation in the Galactic central region.",CO-0.40-_a_06_TM1,"Nagai, Makoto; Kamegai, Kazuhisa;",1.465118807005251,0.0738773246873651,1.0935388803482056,uid://A001/X1465/X17c,uid://A001/X1465/X17d,uid://A002/Xe48598/X10fcb,Search for Self-Gravitating Cores in the Cloud-Cloud Collision Region CO-0.4,S,TARGET,T,11.28074072749406,468750000.0,A002:DA44 A003:DV23 A004:DA56 A005:DV22 A006:DV13 A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A013:DV11 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A019:DA61 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A025:DV10 A026:DV18 A027:DV17 A028:DA59 A030:DA52 A031:DA62 A033:DA49 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A036:DA64 A038:DA60 A039:DV16 A040:DA65 A041:DV03 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A046:DA51 A047:DV06 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A072:DA53,T,2021-07-22T08:55:15.000,1.0841476795432534,"[244.75..245.22GHz,282.23kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,194.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.61..247.49GHz,1128.91kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,96.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [258.83..259.30GHz,282.23kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,199.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [260.34..260.80GHz,282.23kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,199.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",260.57018366712225,324.9961232910867,"Tanaka, Kunihiko",,,T,,Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (6-5)

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars.

The high-mass star-forming clump G286.21+0.17 (G286 for short) that contains an 'L' type filament was thought to undergo global collapse. Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and astrochemistry. ...(9)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions.

The high-mass star-forming clump G286.21+0.17 (G286 for short) that contains an 'L' type filament was thought to undergo global collapse. Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated.

The high-mass star-forming clump G286.21+0.17 (G286 for short) that contains an 'L' type filament was thought to undergo global collapse. Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and astrochemistry. ...(9)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions.

Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and astrochemistry. ...(9)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions. (3) investigate how globally collapse and stellar feedback influence CFE and the distributions of dense gas in proto-clusters.",I17439-2_a_03_TM1,"Bronfman, Leonardo; Yi, Hee-Weon; Juvela, Mika; Goldsmith, Paul; Garay, Guido; Wu, Yuefang; Qin, Sheng-Li; Tej, Anandmayee; Hirota, Tomoya; Kim, Kee-Tae; Yun, Hyeong-Sik; Zhang, Qizhou; Cunningham, Maria; Mardones, Diego; Kang, Sung-ju; Evans, Neal; Wu, Jingwen; Li, Pak Shing; Lee, Jeong-Eun; Wang, Ke; Toth, Laszlo Viktor; Ristorcelli, Isabelle; Liu, Sheng-Yuan; Tatematsu, Ken'ichi;",1.5236963888129382,0.04161893101105735,0.630641758441925,uid://A001/X1465/X288a,uid://A001/X1465/X288b,uid://A002/Xe2ada9/Xf64,On the origin of the dense gas star formation law in Galactic high-mass star forming clumps,S,TARGET,T,16.79358021245167,58593750.0,A001:DA48 A002:DA44 A005:DV22 A006:DV13 A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A024:DA58 A025:DV10 A027:DV17 A033:DA49 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A036:DA64 A040:DA65 A041:DV03 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA59 A072:DA53 A073:DV23 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A091:DA61 A094:DV14 T703:PM01,F,2021-03-31T01:53:23.000,1.309273430413568,"[86.31..86.36GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.72..86.78GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.81..86.87GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.27..87.33GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.60..88.66GHz,61.04kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [89.15..89.21GHz,61.04kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.53..99.40GHz,976.56kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,60uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.46..101.34GHz,976.56kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,63.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",86.8417240467032,205.1133080194908,"Liu, Tie",ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions - I.

We will run this program as a legacy survey, releasing data immediately, and we will produce data products that will inform ongoing and future CMZ programs.",BrickMas_b_06_TM1,"Longmore, Steven; Barnes, Ashley; Walker, Daniel; Kauffmann, Jens; Mills, Elisabeth; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Battersby, Cara; Meier, David; Ott, Juergen; Sanchez-Monge, Alvaro; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett; Rosolowsky, Erik;",0.8163665313272135,0.012456927669940833,0.6683349013328552,uid://A001/X1465/X3a42,uid://A001/X1465/X3a43,uid://A002/Xe48598/X3475f,What lines trace which processes in the CMZ?,S,TARGET,T,10.095640158589392,1875000000.0,A002:DA44 A003:DV23 A004:DA56 A005:DV22 A006:DV13 A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A013:DV11 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A019:DA61 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A025:DV10 A026:DV18 A027:DV17 A028:DA59 A030:DA52 A031:DA62 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A036:DA64 A038:DA60 A039:DV16 A040:DA65 A041:DV03 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A046:DA51 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A072:DA53,F,2021-06-10T10:14:59.000,1.0408636162823248,"[241.68..243.56GHz,976.56kHz,837.4uJy/beam@10km/s,55uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [243.39..245.26GHz,976.56kHz,835.2uJy/beam@10km/s,55.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.09..246.96GHz,976.56kHz,833.1uJy/beam@10km/s,55.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [246.79..248.67GHz,976.56kHz,831uJy/beam@10km/s,55.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [248.50..250.37GHz,976.56kHz,828.9uJy/beam@10km/s,55.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [250.20..252.07GHz,976.56kHz,826.9uJy/beam@10km/s,55.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [251.90..253.78GHz,976.56kHz,824.9uJy/beam@10km/s,55.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [253.60..255.48GHz,976.56kHz,822.9uJy/beam@10km/s,55.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [255.31..257.18GHz,976.56kHz,820.9uJy/beam@10km/s,55.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [257.01..258.89GHz,976.56kHz,819uJy/beam@10km/s,55.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [257.68..259.56GHz,976.56kHz,818.3uJy/beam@10km/s,55.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [259.39..261.26GHz,976.56kHz,816.4uJy/beam@10km/s,55.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [261.09..262.96GHz,976.56kHz,814.5uJy/beam@10km/s,55.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [262.79..264.67GHz,976.56kHz,812.7uJy/beam@10km/s,55.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [264.50..266.37GHz,976.56kHz,821.6uJy/beam@10km/s,56.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [266.20..268.07GHz,976.56kHz,819.8uJy/beam@10km/s,56.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [267.90..269.78GHz,976.56kHz,818uJy/beam@10km/s,56.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [269.60..271.48GHz,976.56kHz,816.2uJy/beam@10km/s,56.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [271.31..273.18GHz,976.56kHz,814.5uJy/beam@10km/s,56.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [273.01..274.89GHz,976.56kHz,812.8uJy/beam@10km/s,56.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",260.3233015841905,1072.3433161655964,"Ginsburg, Adam",,,T,,"Astrochemistry, Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (6-5)

R.","We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array observations of the candidate jet-ISM interaction zones near the black hole X-ray binaries GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942. Using these data, we map the molecular line emission in the regions, detecting emission from the HCN [J = 1-0], HCO<SUP>+</SUP> [J = 1-0], SiO [J = 2-1], CS [J = 2-1], <SUP>13</SUP>CO [J = 1-0], C<SUP>18</SUP>O [J = 1-0], HNCO [J = 4<SUB>0,4</SUB>-3<SUB>0,3</SUB>], HNCO [J = 5<SUB>0,5</SUB>-4<SUB>0,4</SUB>], and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH [J = 2<SUB>1,1</SUB>-1<SUB>1,0</SUB>] molecular transitions. Through examining the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of this emission, we identify molecular structures that may trace jet-driven cavities in the gas surrounding these systems. Our results from the GRS 1758-258 region in particular, are consistent with recent work, which postulated the presence of a jet-blown cocoon structure in deep radio continuum maps of the region. Using these newly discovered molecular structures as calorimeters, we estimate the time averaged jet power from these systems, finding $(1.1{\!-\!}5.7)\times 10^{36}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.12-0.31 Myr for GRS 1758-258 and $(0.7{\!-\!}3.5)\times 10^{37}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.10-0.26 Myr for 1E 1740.7-2942. Additionally, the spectral line characteristics of the detected emission place these molecular structures in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy, thereby constraining the distances to the black hole X-ray binaries to be 8.0 ± 1.0 kpc. Overall, our analysis solidifies the diagnostic capacity of molecular lines, and highlights how astro-chemistry can both identify jet-ISM interaction zones and probe jet feedback from Galactic X-ray binaries.",2020,"Relativistic jets launched from accreting black holes carry large amounts of energy and matter into their environment. Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), the stellar-mass analogues of active galactic nuclei, are ideal targets for studying the interactions between the jet and the ambient ISM in detail, due to their close proximity and the rapid timescale evolution of BHXB jets. Identifying and probing the ISM properties in interaction zones provides insight into highly sought-after jet properties, such as the jet power, composition, duty cycles, and the efficiency of jet feedback. As molecular lines are excellent diagnostics of shock energetics and ISM excitation, our team recently obtained ALMA ACA observations of the candidate interaction sites around the BHXBs GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942, identifying several intriguing compact regions of bright molecular emission. Here we propose follow-up, high resolution ALMA 12m array observations of these fields (total time of 2.3 hours). With these data we will build on our first results to test whether these zones are consistent with being powered by a BHXB jet, and estimate the energy input into the ISM from these BHXB jets.",1E1740.7_b_03_TM1,"Miller-Jones, James; Rosolowsky, Erik; Sivakoff, Gregory;",2.268358233573776,0.06766928554262325,2.9303433895111084,uid://A001/X1469/X284,uid://A001/X1469/X285,uid://A002/Xe407cf/X6f2b,Mapping Jet-ISM Interactions in X-ray Binaries,S,TARGET,T,25.911184425003295,234375000.0,A001:DA48 A002:DA44 A004:DA56 A006:DV13 A007:DV21 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A013:DV11 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A017:DV14 A019:DA61 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A024:DA58 A025:DV10 A027:DV17 A028:DA59 A030:DA52 A031:DA62 A033:DA49 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A036:DA64 A038:DA60 A039:DV16 A041:DV03 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A046:DA51 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A072:DA53 A074:DV09,T,2021-03-17T16:33:42.000,2.6741050494919216,"[86.73..86.96GHz,282.23kHz,2.3mJy/beam@10km/s,252.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.81..88.04GHz,282.23kHz,2.3mJy/beam@10km/s,252.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.51..88.75GHz,282.23kHz,2.2mJy/beam@10km/s,241.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [89.07..89.31GHz,282.23kHz,2.1mJy/beam@10km/s,241.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.75..98.22GHz,282.23kHz,2.1mJy/beam@10km/s,171.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.00..100.99GHz,31250.00kHz,2.2mJy/beam@10km/s,91.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",86.84677726724999,865.6065630629148,"Tetarenko, Alexandra",Jet-ISM interactions near the microquasars GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942,"Tetarenko, A.

We suppose the kinematics of multiple expanding shells, orbital motions around a compact mass, and outflows from protostars.

CO-0.4 is a newly-discovered candidate site of an on-going CCC event; ALMA observations have revealed two distinct velocity components bridged by broad emissions of SiO 5-4 line, which is a classical signpost of CCC.

Since then, the global maser community has discovered 20 new torsionally-excited methanol maser transitions from 6 to 360 GHz toward this source(!), all likely powered by an ongoing accretion outburst in a massive protostar.

Measuring the lifetime of the excited masers and the rate of decline of the heated dust continuum is now critical to compare to the first two cases, which we will achieve by repeating the 400 au resolution DDT observations in Band 5 and 7.

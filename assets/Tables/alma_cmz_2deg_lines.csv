In the search for the building blocks of life, nitrogen-bearing molecules are of particular interest since nitrogen-containing bonds are essential for the linking of amino acids and ultimately the formation of larger biological structures. The elusive molecule methylamine (CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB>) is thought to be a key pre-biotic species but has so far only been securely detected in the giant molecular cloud Sagittarius B2. <BR /> Aims: We identify CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> and other simple nitrogen-bearing species involved in the synthesis of biologically relevant molecules towards three hot cores associated with the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6334I, located at a distance of 1.3 kpc. Column density ratios are derived in order to investigate the relevance of the individual species as precursors of biotic molecules. <BR /> Methods: High sensitivity, high angular and spectral resolution observations obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array were used to study transitions of CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB>, CH<SUB>2</SUB>NH, NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO, and the <SUP>13</SUP>C- and <SUP>15</SUP>N-methyl cyanide (CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN) isotopologues, detected towards NGC 6334I. Column densities are derived for each species assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and excitation temperatures in the range 220-340 K for CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB>, 70-110 K for the CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN isotopologues and 120-215 K for NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO and CH<SUB>2</SUB>NH. <BR /> Results: We report the first detections of CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> towards NGC 6334I with column density ratios with respect to CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH of 5.9 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>, 1.5 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> and 5.4 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> for the three hot cores MM1, MM2, and MM3, respectively. These values are slightly lower than the values derived for Sagittarius B2 but higher by more than an order of magnitude as compared with the values derived for the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422B. The column density ratios of NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO, <SUP>13</SUP>CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUP>15</SUP>N with respect to CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH are (1.5 - 1.9) × 10<SUP>-4</SUP>, (1.0 - 4.6) × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> and (1.7 - 3.0) × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> respectively. Lower limits of 5.2, 1.2, and 3.0 are reported for the CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> to CH<SUB>2</SUB>NH column density ratio for MM1, MM2, and MM3 respectively. These limits are largely consistent with the values derived for Sagittarius B2 and higher than those for IRAS 16293-2422B. <BR /> Conclusions: The detections of CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> in the hot cores of NGC 6334I hint that CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> is generally common in the interstellar medium, albeit that high-sensitivity observations are essential forthe detection of the species. The good agreement between model predictions of CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> ratios and the observations towards NGC 6334I indicate a main formation pathway via radical recombination on grain surfaces. This process may be stimulated further by high grain temperatures allowing a lager degree of radical mobility. Further observations with ALMA will help evaluate the degree to which CH<SUB>3</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB> chemistry depends on the temperature of the grains in high- and low-mass star-forming regions respectively. ...(3)",2017,"The aim of this project is the first detection of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) in the interstellar medium. NH2OH is an important precursor in space for the formation of amino acids - the building blocks of life. Abundances within reach of ALMA are predicted from recent laboratory experiments in our group that have focused on the solid-state chemistry of nitrogen oxides in interstellar ice analogs. Our results show that for low temperatures, NO and NO2 ices are readily converted into NH2OH upon sequential hydrogenation, yielding a stable end-product. In warmer environments, NH2OH can thermally desorb, yielding detectable gas-phase abundances, while in shocked regions, the solid NH2OH can be liberated en masse into the gas phase.

The 89 GHz emission is area-filling, optically thick, and sub-thermally excited. Two types of filaments are seen in absorption against the HCO+ emission. Broad-line absorption filaments (BLAs) have widths of less than a few arcseconds (0.07-0.14 pc), lengths of 30-50 arcsec (1.2-1.8 pc), and absorption profiles extending over a velocity range larger than 20 km s–1. The BLAs are nearly parallel to the nearby G0.18 non-thermal filaments and may trace HCO+ molecules gyrating about highly ordered magnetic fields located in front of G0.253+0.016 or edge-on sheets formed behind supersonic shocks propagating orthogonal to our line of sight in the foreground. Narrow-line absorption filaments (NLAs) have line widths less than 20 km s–1. Some NLAs are also seen in absorption in other species with high optical depth, such as HCN, and occasionally in emission where the background is faint. The NLAs, which also trace low-density, sub-thermally excited HCO+ molecules, are mostly seen on the blueshifted side of the emission from G0.253+0.016. If associated with the surface of G0.253+0.016, the kinematics of the NLAs indicate that the cloud surface is expanding. The decompression of entrained, milli-Gauss magnetic fields may be responsible for the re-expansion of the surface layers of G0.253+0.016 as it recedes from the Galactic center following a close encounter with Sgr A. Despite the simplicity of theoretical models of supersonically turbulent, isothermal media, their predictions successfully match the observed gas structure and star formation activity within low-pressure (P/k &#60; 105 K cm–3) molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood. However, it is unknown whether or not these theories extend to clouds in high-pressure (P/k &#62; 107 K cm–3) environments, like those in the Galaxy's inner 200 pc central molecular zone (CMZ) and in the early universe. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 3 mm dust continuum emission within a cloud, G0.253+0.016, which is immersed in the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. While the log-normal shape and dispersion of its column density probability distribution function (PDF) are strikingly similar to those of solar neighborhood clouds, there is one important quantitative difference: its mean column density is one to two orders of magnitude higher. Both the similarity and difference in the PDF compared to those derived from solar neighborhood clouds match predictions of turbulent cloud models given the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. The PDF shows a small deviation from log-normal at high column densities confirming the youth of G0.253+0.016. Its lack of star formation is consistent with the theoretically predicted, environmentally dependent volume density threshold for star formation which is orders of magnitude higher than that derived for solar neighborhood clouds. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that the current theoretical understanding of molecular cloud structure derived from the solar neighborhood also holds in high-pressure environments. We therefore suggest that these theories may be applicable to understand star formation in the early universe. ...(9)",2014,"Clusters are the building blocks of galaxies and the nurseries of most stellar systems. Despite their importance, even the fundamental question of whether a single mechanism can describe cluster formation across the mass range from open clusters to globular clusters remains unclear. Answering this question requires observations of a cluster's natal dust and gas well before the onset of star formation. We have identified an extreme molecular cloud that appears to be on the verge of forming a massive cluster. This cloud, G0.25+0.02, is very cold, massive, and dense with no obvious star formation and shows tantalizing evidence that it is highly substructured and, thus, may be undergoing hierarchical fragmentation. Using the ALMA early science extended configuration we aim to obtain a ~3 x 1 arcmin mosaic of the dust continuum and molecular line emission across this cloud at 90 GHz. These observations will reveal the location, mass, and kinematics of the small-scale fragments within the cloud allowing us to distinguish between competing cluster formation models. These observations can only be achieved with the order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and dynamic range provided by ALMA. Determining whether clusters form via a single mechanism across the entire mass range has profound implications: if confirmed, this implies our knowledge of nearby cluster formation can be used as framework to understand star formation across cosmic time, back to globular clusters ~10Gyr ago.

The 89 GHz emission is area-filling, optically thick, and sub-thermally excited. Two types of filaments are seen in absorption against the HCO+ emission. Broad-line absorption filaments (BLAs) have widths of less than a few arcseconds (0.07-0.14 pc), lengths of 30-50 arcsec (1.2-1.8 pc), and absorption profiles extending over a velocity range larger than 20 km s–1. The BLAs are nearly parallel to the nearby G0.18 non-thermal filaments and may trace HCO+ molecules gyrating about highly ordered magnetic fields located in front of G0.253+0.016 or edge-on sheets formed behind supersonic shocks propagating orthogonal to our line of sight in the foreground. Narrow-line absorption filaments (NLAs) have line widths less than 20 km s–1. Some NLAs are also seen in absorption in other species with high optical depth, such as HCN, and occasionally in emission where the background is faint. The NLAs, which also trace low-density, sub-thermally excited HCO+ molecules, are mostly seen on the blueshifted side of the emission from G0.253+0.016. If associated with the surface of G0.253+0.016, the kinematics of the NLAs indicate that the cloud surface is expanding. The decompression of entrained, milli-Gauss magnetic fields may be responsible for the re-expansion of the surface layers of G0.253+0.016 as it recedes from the Galactic center following a close encounter with Sgr A. Despite the simplicity of theoretical models of supersonically turbulent, isothermal media, their predictions successfully match the observed gas structure and star formation activity within low-pressure (P/k &#60; 105 K cm–3) molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood. However, it is unknown whether or not these theories extend to clouds in high-pressure (P/k &#62; 107 K cm–3) environments, like those in the Galaxy's inner 200 pc central molecular zone (CMZ) and in the early universe. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 3 mm dust continuum emission within a cloud, G0.253+0.016, which is immersed in the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. While the log-normal shape and dispersion of its column density probability distribution function (PDF) are strikingly similar to those of solar neighborhood clouds, there is one important quantitative difference: its mean column density is one to two orders of magnitude higher. Both the similarity and difference in the PDF compared to those derived from solar neighborhood clouds match predictions of turbulent cloud models given the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. The PDF shows a small deviation from log-normal at high column densities confirming the youth of G0.253+0.016. Its lack of star formation is consistent with the theoretically predicted, environmentally dependent volume density threshold for star formation which is orders of magnitude higher than that derived for solar neighborhood clouds. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that the current theoretical understanding of molecular cloud structure derived from the solar neighborhood also holds in high-pressure environments. We therefore suggest that these theories may be applicable to understand star formation in the early universe. ...(9)",2014,"Clusters are the building blocks of galaxies and the nurseries of most stellar systems. Despite their importance, even the fundamental question of whether a single mechanism can describe cluster formation across the mass range from open clusters to globular clusters remains unclear. Answering this question requires observations of a cluster's natal dust and gas well before the onset of star formation. We have identified an extreme molecular cloud that appears to be on the verge of forming a massive cluster. This cloud, G0.25+0.02, is very cold, massive, and dense with no obvious star formation and shows tantalizing evidence that it is highly substructured and, thus, may be undergoing hierarchical fragmentation. Using the ALMA early science extended configuration we aim to obtain a ~3 x 1 arcmin mosaic of the dust continuum and molecular line emission across this cloud at 90 GHz. These observations will reveal the location, mass, and kinematics of the small-scale fragments within the cloud allowing us to distinguish between competing cluster formation models. These observations can only be achieved with the order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and dynamic range provided by ALMA. Determining whether clusters form via a single mechanism across the entire mass range has profound implications: if confirmed, this implies our knowledge of nearby cluster formation can be used as framework to understand star formation across cosmic time, back to globular clusters ~10Gyr ago.

Xue, Ci; Remijan, Anthony J.; Burkhardt, Andrew M.; Herbst, Eric","Aminoacetonitrile (NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) was detected in the interstellar medium (ISM) one decade ago in the course of a spectral survey of the hot molecular core Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) with the IRAM 30 m telescope. With the advent of sensitive telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the degree of chemical complexity in the ISM can be further explored. In the family of aminoacetonitrile, the next stage in complexity with one additional CH<SUB>2</SUB> group is aminopropionitrile. This molecule has two structural isomers, a chain-like (3-aminopropionitrile, NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) and a branched, chiral one (2-aminopropionitrile, CH<SUB>3</SUB>CH(NH<SUB>2</SUB>) CN). The latter was studied in the laboratory a few years ago and was not detected in the IRAM 30 m survey. We present the search for both isomers in the EMoCA (Exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA) survey, a sensitive spectral survey of Sgr B2(N) performed with ALMA. The rotational spectrum of 3-aminopropionitrile has been recorded in laboratory with a submillimeter spectrometer using solid-state sources. Helped by ab initio calculations performed for the different possible conformations, we present here the analysis based on a Watson Hamiltonian for an asymmetric one-top rotor in A-reduction performed in the frequency range 150-500 GHz for two conformers. More than 6200 lines of the ground-state and lowest excited vibrational states, corresponding to more than 8200 transitions, were assigned in the experimental spectrum. Partition functions, including the vibrational contribution of these states, and predictions in the JPL-CDMS catalog format were determined in order to search for both conformers of 3-aminopropionitrile in Sgr B2(N). Neither 3-aminopropionitrile, nor 2-aminopropionitrile are detected. The derived upper limits imply that they are at least 12 and 5 times less abundant than aminoacetonitrile, respectively. A comparison to ethyl cyanide and n-propyl cyanide detected in this source suggests that an improvement by a factor three in sensitivity may be sufficient to detect 3-aminopropionitrile, which should be within the range of our on-going follow-up project with ALMA. ...(20)",2014,"The search for complex pre-biotic and biotic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) will be a primary focus of ALMA science. The molecular inventory of meteorites found on Earth includes more than 80 distinct amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), and their composition suggests an interstellar origin. The key search site for new complex organics in the ISM is the hot dense core Sgr B2(N), due partly to its high column density. However, the firm identification of new molecules requires a robust spectral model to unweave the emission lines of weakly-emitting, more complex, species from known molecules. We have already constructed a unique model of this kind, using our previous single-dish line survey, which has already allowed our team to uncover several new species. We propose to use ALMA Early Science to perform a deep, unbiased line survey of Sgr B2(N) in band 3 (8 hours observing time). The proposed survey will improve the detection threshold for complex organic molecules by nearly a factor of 20 compared to our previous survey of this source. Such a sensitivity improvement should lead to the firm detection of a few, perhaps a dozen, new complex organics, while the adaptation of our existing spectral model will allow a rapid turn-around from detection to publication.

Xue, Ci; Remijan, Anthony J.; Burkhardt, Andrew M.; Herbst, Eric","Aminoacetonitrile (NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) was detected in the interstellar medium (ISM) one decade ago in the course of a spectral survey of the hot molecular core Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) with the IRAM 30 m telescope. With the advent of sensitive telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the degree of chemical complexity in the ISM can be further explored. In the family of aminoacetonitrile, the next stage in complexity with one additional CH<SUB>2</SUB> group is aminopropionitrile. This molecule has two structural isomers, a chain-like (3-aminopropionitrile, NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) and a branched, chiral one (2-aminopropionitrile, CH<SUB>3</SUB>CH(NH<SUB>2</SUB>) CN). The latter was studied in the laboratory a few years ago and was not detected in the IRAM 30 m survey. We present the search for both isomers in the EMoCA (Exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA) survey, a sensitive spectral survey of Sgr B2(N) performed with ALMA. The rotational spectrum of 3-aminopropionitrile has been recorded in laboratory with a submillimeter spectrometer using solid-state sources. Helped by ab initio calculations performed for the different possible conformations, we present here the analysis based on a Watson Hamiltonian for an asymmetric one-top rotor in A-reduction performed in the frequency range 150-500 GHz for two conformers. More than 6200 lines of the ground-state and lowest excited vibrational states, corresponding to more than 8200 transitions, were assigned in the experimental spectrum. Partition functions, including the vibrational contribution of these states, and predictions in the JPL-CDMS catalog format were determined in order to search for both conformers of 3-aminopropionitrile in Sgr B2(N). Neither 3-aminopropionitrile, nor 2-aminopropionitrile are detected. The derived upper limits imply that they are at least 12 and 5 times less abundant than aminoacetonitrile, respectively. A comparison to ethyl cyanide and n-propyl cyanide detected in this source suggests that an improvement by a factor three in sensitivity may be sufficient to detect 3-aminopropionitrile, which should be within the range of our on-going follow-up project with ALMA. ...(20)",2014,"The search for complex pre-biotic and biotic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) will be a primary focus of ALMA science. The molecular inventory of meteorites found on Earth includes more than 80 distinct amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), and their composition suggests an interstellar origin. The key search site for new complex organics in the ISM is the hot dense core Sgr B2(N), due partly to its high column density. However, the firm identification of new molecules requires a robust spectral model to unweave the emission lines of weakly-emitting, more complex, species from known molecules. We have already constructed a unique model of this kind, using our previous single-dish line survey, which has already allowed our team to uncover several new species. We propose to use ALMA Early Science to perform a deep, unbiased line survey of Sgr B2(N) in band 3 (8 hours observing time). The proposed survey will improve the detection threshold for complex organic molecules by nearly a factor of 20 compared to our previous survey of this source. Such a sensitivity improvement should lead to the firm detection of a few, perhaps a dozen, new complex organics, while the adaptation of our existing spectral model will allow a rapid turn-around from detection to publication. The use of our team's cutting edge chemical models will allow the broader implications of new discoveries to be understood, and place strong constraints on chemical formation pathways.

Xue, Ci; Remijan, Anthony J.; Burkhardt, Andrew M.; Herbst, Eric","Aminoacetonitrile (NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) was detected in the interstellar medium (ISM) one decade ago in the course of a spectral survey of the hot molecular core Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) with the IRAM 30 m telescope. With the advent of sensitive telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the degree of chemical complexity in the ISM can be further explored. In the family of aminoacetonitrile, the next stage in complexity with one additional CH<SUB>2</SUB> group is aminopropionitrile. This molecule has two structural isomers, a chain-like (3-aminopropionitrile, NH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CH<SUB>2</SUB>CN) and a branched, chiral one (2-aminopropionitrile, CH<SUB>3</SUB>CH(NH<SUB>2</SUB>) CN). The latter was studied in the laboratory a few years ago and was not detected in the IRAM 30 m survey. We present the search for both isomers in the EMoCA (Exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA) survey, a sensitive spectral survey of Sgr B2(N) performed with ALMA. The rotational spectrum of 3-aminopropionitrile has been recorded in laboratory with a submillimeter spectrometer using solid-state sources. Helped by ab initio calculations performed for the different possible conformations, we present here the analysis based on a Watson Hamiltonian for an asymmetric one-top rotor in A-reduction performed in the frequency range 150-500 GHz for two conformers. More than 6200 lines of the ground-state and lowest excited vibrational states, corresponding to more than 8200 transitions, were assigned in the experimental spectrum. Partition functions, including the vibrational contribution of these states, and predictions in the JPL-CDMS catalog format were determined in order to search for both conformers of 3-aminopropionitrile in Sgr B2(N). Neither 3-aminopropionitrile, nor 2-aminopropionitrile are detected. The derived upper limits imply that they are at least 12 and 5 times less abundant than aminoacetonitrile, respectively. A comparison to ethyl cyanide and n-propyl cyanide detected in this source suggests that an improvement by a factor three in sensitivity may be sufficient to detect 3-aminopropionitrile, which should be within the range of our on-going follow-up project with ALMA. ...(20)",2014,"The search for complex pre-biotic and biotic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) will be a primary focus of ALMA science. The molecular inventory of meteorites found on Earth includes more than 80 distinct amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), and their composition suggests an interstellar origin. The key search site for new complex organics in the ISM is the hot dense core Sgr B2(N), due partly to its high column density. However, the firm identification of new molecules requires a robust spectral model to unweave the emission lines of weakly-emitting, more complex, species from known molecules. We have already constructed a unique model of this kind, using our previous single-dish line survey, which has already allowed our team to uncover several new species. We propose to use ALMA Early Science to perform a deep, unbiased line survey of Sgr B2(N) in band 3 (8 hours observing time). The proposed survey will improve the detection threshold for complex organic molecules by nearly a factor of 20 compared to our previous survey of this source. Such a sensitivity improvement should lead to the firm detection of a few, perhaps a dozen, new complex organics, while the adaptation of our existing spectral model will allow a rapid turn-around from detection to publication.

Although the existence of vinyl cyanide (C2H3CN) on Titan was previously inferred using Cassini mass spectrometry, a definitive detection has been lacking until now. We report the first spectroscopic detection of vinyl cyanide in Titan's atmosphere, obtained using archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), collected from February to May 2014. We detect the three strongest rotational lines of C2H3CN in the frequency range of 230 to 232 GHz, each with >4σ confidence. Radiative transfer modeling suggests that most of the C2H3CN emission originates at altitudes of ≥200 km, in agreement with recent photochemical models. The vertical column densities implied by our best-fitting models lie in the range of 3.7 × 10^13 to 1.4 × 10^14 cm-2. The corresponding production rate of vinyl cyanide and its saturation mole fraction imply the availability of sufficient dissolved material to form ~10^7 cell membranes/cm3 in Titan's sea Ligeia Mare. We have exploited ALMA calibration observations to carry out a novel, wide, and deep submillimeter (submm) survey, almacal. These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of ˜25 μJy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on ≥5σ detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S 1.2 mm ≥ 0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 μm and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2×. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs—representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies—in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution. ...(1)",2015,"Sgr A* in the Galactic Center is by now the best constrained supermassive black hole candidate. Its radio spectrum peaks at submm-waves and its size as measured with VLBI experiments shrinks with increasing frequency, exhibiting a clear size-frequency relation. The millimeter-wave emission comes from less than four Schwarzschild radii (R_S) and will allow imaging of the event horizon with mmVLBI in the future. The predicted close encounter of the G2 gas cloud in mid-2013 will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study accretion processes on scales from a few thousand to a few R_S and explore the accretion-jet coupling that may take place in Sgr A*. First discovered through NIR astrometric imaging, G2 contains at least 3 M_Earth of dusty, ionized gas that is undergoing tidal disruption and will reach periastron of 3100 R_S. The millimeter flux density will rise as gas reaches a few R_S, which could be as short as the free fall time of a few months or as long as the viscous time of years to decades. Increased accretion rates could lead to an order of magnitude increase in the flux density, which will be indicative of a new accretion-jet state that can be imaged with VLBI. The G2 encounter represents a low mass, large impact parameter analog to stellar tidal disruption events, which have recently been show to produce coupled accretion and outflow events. We request 10 epochs of band 6 and 7 flux monitoring to search for evidence of increased accretion onto Sgr A*. This proposal is part of a multi-wavelength campaign to study the G2 encounter; we have approved multi-epoch Chandra X-ray time to observe Sgr A* in 2013. Finally, the integrated data set coupled with our Cycle 0 data will provide the best-ever multi-frequency map of the gas streamers (Sgr A West) in the Galactic Center and probe for new compact structures.",April_SgrA_352-216_12m_C32-any,"Fragile, Patrick; Baganoff, Frederick; Maitra, Dipankar; Schaaf, Reinhold; Utomo, Dyas; Moscibrodzka, Monika; Falcke, Heino; Brunthaler, Andreas; Menten, Karl; Brinkerink, Christiaan; Markoff, Sera; Marrone, Dan; Barkats, Denis; Dexter, Jason; Impellizzeri, Violette; Peck, Alison; Gammie, Charles; Rushton, Anthony; wright, melvyn;",1.390335868586582,0.03111643805431051,1.221979022026062,uid://A002/X7d1738/X41,uid://A002/X7d1738/X42,uid://A002/X7fb89e/Xa06,The G2 Gas Cloud Encounter with Sagittarius A*: Accretion Structure on Scales of 3000 to 1 Schwarzschild Radii,S,TARGET WVR,T,3.6682525427088115,1875000000.0,A006:DV07 A010:DV12 A011:DV22 A015:DV21 A016:DA62 A018:DA60 A021:DA59 A031:DV11 A033:DV18 A034:DV20 A038:DV24 A045:DA50 A046:DA48 A056:DV25 A058:DA46 A062:DV05 A063:DA54 A066:DA43 A067:DV13 A068:DA44 A069:DV16 A071:DV10 A072:DV01 A074:DA47 A075:DA61 A077:DV19 A078:DV04 A080:DA55 A081:DA42 A083:DV14 A085:DA64 A087:DV02 A138:DV17 T701:PM03 T703:PM04,F,2015-05-16T14:20:52.000,0.442543267264854,"[215.01..217.00GHz,31250.00kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,78.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [217.01..219.00GHz,31250.00kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,78.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [230.96..232.83GHz,976.56kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,81.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [232.78..234.76GHz,31250.00kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,79.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [338.63..340.61GHz,31250.00kHz,1.1mJy/beam@10km/s,84.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [340.61..342.59GHz,31250.00kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,105.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [350.73..352.72GHz,31250.00kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,106.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [352.66..354.54GHz,976.56kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,110.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",353.60004999375076,825.6763679677523,"Bower, Geoffrey","ALMA detection and astrobiological potential of vinyl cyanide on Titan ALMACAL I: First Dual-band Number Counts from a Deep and Wide ALMA Submillimeter Survey, Free from Cosmic Variance Radio and Millimeter Monitoring of Sgr A*: Spectrum, Variability, and ","Bower, Geoffrey C.

Depending upon the mass of this gas reservoir, the fate of the CND (whether it will it form stars, or eventually accrete on the black hole) will have a substantial impact on the evolution of the central parsec of our Galaxy. Its fate depends upon its density: gas clumps with densities > 10^7 cm^-3 are stable, and can collapse and form stars, whereas unstable clumps should quickly be sheared apart and eventually accrete onto the black hole.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_7M,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",86.97432434467754,1.7264628290144566,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X121/X4bc,uid://A002/X85b7b2/Xb3,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,TARGET,T,90.12415312315139,1992187500.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J506:CM05 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2015-08-29T01:53:46.000,12.868083618201824,"[88.48..90.47GHz,488.28kHz,87.8mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.29..92.28GHz,488.28kHz,87mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.37..102.36GHz,488.28kHz,82.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.23..104.22GHz,488.28kHz,87.1mJy/beam@10km/s,3.6mJy/beam@native, XX]",91.28225599645145,1404.5227716097966,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_7M,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",87.82645131893493,1.7264628290144566,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X121/X4bc,uid://A002/X85b7b2/Xb3,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,TARGET,T,90.12415312315139,1992187500.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J506:CM05 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2015-08-29T01:53:46.000,12.868083618201824,"[88.48..90.47GHz,488.28kHz,87.8mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.29..92.28GHz,488.28kHz,87mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.37..102.36GHz,488.28kHz,82.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.23..104.22GHz,488.28kHz,87.1mJy/beam@10km/s,3.6mJy/beam@native, XX]",89.47851885429894,1404.5227716097966,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

Classical hot cores are rich in molecular emission, and they show a high abundance of complex organic molecules (COMs). The emergence of molecular complexity that is represented by COMs, in particular, is poorly constrained in the early evolution of hot cores. <BR /> Aims: We put observational constraints on the physical location of COMs in a resolved high-mass protostellar envelope associated with the G328.2551-0.5321 clump. The protostar is single down to 400 au scales and we resolved the envelope structure down to this scale. <BR /> Methods: High angular resolution observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array allowed us to resolve the structure of the inner envelope and pin down the emission region of COMs. We use local thermodynamic equilibrium modelling of the available 7.5 GHz bandwidth around 345 GHz to identify the COMs towards two accretion shocks and a selected position representing the bulk emission of the inner envelope. We quantitatively discuss the derived molecular column densities and abundances towards these positions, and use our line identification to qualitatively compare this to the emission of COMs seen towards the central position, corresponding to the protostar and its accretion disk. <BR /> Results: We detect emission from 10 COMs, and identify a line of deuterated water (HDO). In addition to methanol (CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), methyl formate (CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO) and formamide (HC(O)NH<SUB>2</SUB>) have the most extended emission. Together with HDO, these molecules are found to be associated with both the accretion shocks and the inner envelope, which has a moderate temperature of T<SUB>kin</SUB> 110 K. We find a significant difference in the distribution of COMs. O-bearing COMs, such as ethanol, acetone, and ethylene glycol are almost exclusively found and show a higher abundance towards the accretion shocks with T<SUB>kin</SUB> 180 K. Whereas N-bearing COMs with a CN group, such as vinyl and ethyl cyanide peak on the central position, thus the protostar and the accretion disk. The molecular composition is similar towards the two shock positions, while it is significantly different towards the inner envelope, suggesting an increase in abundance of O-bearing COMs towards the accretion shocks. <BR /> Conclusions: We present the first observational evidence for a large column density of COMs seen towards accretion shocks at the centrifugal barrier at the inner envelope. The overall molecular emission shows increased molecular abundances of COMs towards the accretion shocks compared to the inner envelope. The bulk of the gas from the inner envelope is still at a moderate temperature of T<SUB>kin</SUB> 110 K, and we find that the radiatively heated inner region is very compact (&lt;1000 au). Since the molecular composition is dominated by that of the accretion shocks and the radiatively heated hot inner region is very compact, we propose this source to be a precursor to a classical, radiatively heated hot core. By imaging the physical location of HDO, we find that it is consistent with an origin within the moderately heated inner envelope, suggesting that it originates from sublimation of ice from the grain surface and its destruction in the vicinity of the heating source has not been efficient yet. <P />A copy of the reduced datacubes is available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/632/A57"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/632/A57</A> ...(6)",2017,"The origin of massive stars is a fundamental open issue in modern astrophysics. Pre-ALMA interferometric studies reveal precursors to early B to late O type stars with collapsing envelopes of 15-20 Msol in 1000-3000 AU. There are exceptionally few examples known to date of more massive envelopes at these size-scales. Do massive collapsing envelopes exist within this size-scale up to the 100msol regime? Do they form the same way as the so far observed 8-20 Msol regime? To answer these questions a statistical sample is the necessary next step. Here we target a well characterized sample of massive and cold clumps above 650 Msol within 4.5 kpc identified by the ATLASGAL survey in order to reveal the most massive individual collapsing envelopes on 3000 AU size scales (with 0.6"" angular resolution). We will drastically increase the number of 20-100 Msol envelopes known to date. We also target molecular tracers to distinguish between pre-stellar and protostellar condensations allowing statistical life-time estimates for the elusive pre-stellar phase.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment.

Depending upon the mass of this gas reservoir, the fate of the CND (whether it will it form stars, or eventually accrete on the black hole) will have a substantial impact on the evolution of the central parsec of our Galaxy. Its fate depends upon its density: gas clumps with densities > 10^7 cm^-3 are stable, and can collapse and form stars, whereas unstable clumps should quickly be sheared apart and eventually accrete onto the black hole. We propose to use the resolution and sensitivity of Cycle 2 ALMA to conduct a robust probe of gas density on the scales of individual clumps (1"", or 0.04 pc) via simultaneous excitation analyses of multiple tracers and the inclusion of radiative excitation.

The origins of such `supermassive' black holes (SMBHs) remain unknown1, although those of stellar-mass black holes are well understood. One possible scenario is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), which are formed by the runaway coalescence of stars in young compact star clusters2, merge at the centre of a galaxy to form a SMBH3. Although many candidates for IMBHs have been proposed, none is accepted as definitive. Recently, we discovered a peculiar molecular cloud, CO-0.40-0.22, with an extremely broad velocity width, near the centre of our Milky Way galaxy. Based on the careful analysis of gas kinematics, we concluded that a compact object with a mass of about 105M⊙ is lurking in this cloud4. Here we report the detection of a point-like continuum source as well as a compact gas clump near the centre of CO-0.40-0.22. This point-like continuum source (CO-0.40-0.22*) has a wide-band spectrum consistent with 1/500 of the Galactic SMBH (Sgr A*) in luminosity. Numerical simulations around a point-like massive object reproduce the kinematics of dense molecular gas well, which suggests that CO-0.40-0.22* is one of the most promising candidates for an intermediate-mass black hole. This paper reports a reanalysis of archival ALMA data of the high velocity(-width) compact cloud CO−0.40─0.22, which has recently been hypothesized to host an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). If beam-smearing effects, difference in beam sizes among frequency bands, and Doppler shift due to the motion of the Earth are considered accurately, none of the features reported as evidence for an IMBH in previous studies are confirmed in the reanalyzed ALMA images. Instead, through analysis of the position─velocity structure of the HCN J = 3─2 data cube, we have found kinematics typical of a cloud─cloud collision (CCC), namely, two distinct velocity components bridged by broad emission features with elevated temperatures and/or densities. One velocity component has a straight filamentary shape with approximately constant centroid velocities along its length but with a steep, V-shaped velocity gradient across its width. This contradicts the IMBH scenario but is consistent with a collision between two dissimilar-sized clouds. From a non-LTE analysis of the multitransition methanol lines, the volume density of the post-shock gas has been measured to be ≳10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>−3</SUP>, indicating that the CCC shock can compress gas in a short timescale to densities typical of star-forming regions. Evidence for star formation has not been found, possibly because the cloud is in an early phase of CCC-triggered star formation or because the collision is nonproductive.",2017,"High-velocity compact cloud (HVCC) is a peculiar population of molecular cloud found in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy with the NRO 45m telescope CO J=1-0 survey. They have compact size, extremely large velocity width, and enormous kinetic energy ranging from 1E49 to 1E52 ergs, while their driving sources are still unidentified. CO -0.40-0.22 is one of energetic HVCC (Ekin ~ 1E51 erg) with a featureless appearance. Our observations with ASTE have revealed that it has intense CO J=2-1 and HCN J=3-2 emission suggestive of high density and moderate temperature. We propose to make 7-point mosaic observations of CO -0.40-0.22 with ALMA. HCN J=3-2 and CO J=2-1 lines will be observed to obtain detailed spatial-velocity information to diagnose its kinematics: (1) rotation around a dark mass, (2) expanding shells/bubbles, or (3) supersonic collision. Cases (1) and (2) are indicative of an embedded, aged super star cluster (SSC), which could be a womb of intermediate mass black hole.

Although the existence of vinyl cyanide (C2H3CN) on Titan was previously inferred using Cassini mass spectrometry, a definitive detection has been lacking until now. We report the first spectroscopic detection of vinyl cyanide in Titan's atmosphere, obtained using archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), collected from February to May 2014. We detect the three strongest rotational lines of C2H3CN in the frequency range of 230 to 232 GHz, each with >4σ confidence. Radiative transfer modeling suggests that most of the C2H3CN emission originates at altitudes of ≥200 km, in agreement with recent photochemical models. The vertical column densities implied by our best-fitting models lie in the range of 3.7 × 10^13 to 1.4 × 10^14 cm-2. The corresponding production rate of vinyl cyanide and its saturation mole fraction imply the availability of sufficient dissolved material to form ~10^7 cell membranes/cm3 in Titan's sea Ligeia Mare. We have exploited ALMA calibration observations to carry out a novel, wide, and deep submillimeter (submm) survey, almacal. These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of ˜25 μJy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on ≥5σ detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S 1.2 mm ≥ 0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 μm and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2×. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs—representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies—in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution. ...(1)",2015,"Sgr A* in the Galactic Center is by now the best constrained supermassive black hole candidate. Its radio spectrum peaks at submm-waves and its size as measured with VLBI experiments shrinks with increasing frequency, exhibiting a clear size-frequency relation. The millimeter-wave emission comes from less than four Schwarzschild radii (R_S) and will allow imaging of the event horizon with mmVLBI in the future. The predicted close encounter of the G2 gas cloud in mid-2013 will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study accretion processes on scales from a few thousand to a few R_S and explore the accretion-jet coupling that may take place in Sgr A*. First discovered through NIR astrometric imaging, G2 contains at least 3 M_Earth of dusty, ionized gas that is undergoing tidal disruption and will reach periastron of 3100 R_S. The millimeter flux density will rise as gas reaches a few R_S, which could be as short as the free fall time of a few months or as long as the viscous time of years to decades. Increased accretion rates could lead to an order of magnitude increase in the flux density, which will be indicative of a new accretion-jet state that can be imaged with VLBI. The G2 encounter represents a low mass, large impact parameter analog to stellar tidal disruption events, which have recently been show to produce coupled accretion and outflow events. We request 10 epochs of band 6 and 7 flux monitoring to search for evidence of increased accretion onto Sgr A*. This proposal is part of a multi-wavelength campaign to study the G2 encounter; we have approved multi-epoch Chandra X-ray time to observe Sgr A* in 2013. Finally, the integrated data set coupled with our Cycle 0 data will provide the best-ever multi-frequency map of the gas streamers (Sgr A West) in the Galactic Center and probe for new compact structures.",March_SgrA_352-216_12m_C32-any,"Fragile, Patrick; Baganoff, Frederick; Maitra, Dipankar; Schaaf, Reinhold; Utomo, Dyas; Moscibrodzka, Monika; Falcke, Heino; Brunthaler, Andreas; Menten, Karl; Brinkerink, Christiaan; Markoff, Sera; Marrone, Dan; Barkats, Denis; Dexter, Jason; Impellizzeri, Violette; Peck, Alison; Gammie, Charles; Rushton, Anthony; wright, melvyn;",1.496228380132455,0.03286618238211964,0.6336683630943298,uid://A002/X7d1738/X3e,uid://A002/X7d1738/X3f,uid://A002/X7d2ec1/Xbf7,The G2 Gas Cloud Encounter with Sagittarius A*: Accretion Structure on Scales of 3000 to 1 Schwarzschild Radii,S,TARGET WVR,T,5.280636854204882,1875000000.0,A001:DA64 A006:DV07 A007:DV23 A010:DV12 A011:DV22 A015:DV21 A017:DA51 A018:DA60 A025:DV14 A031:DV11 A033:DV18 A034:DV20 A036:DV02 A037:DV06 A038:DV24 A045:DA50 A046:DA48 A050:DA42 A056:DV25 A058:DA46 A063:DA54 A066:DA43 A067:DV13 A068:DA44 A070:DA45 A072:DV01 A074:DA47 A075:DA61 A076:DA57 A078:DV04 A079:DA41 A137:DA55 A138:DV17 T701:PM03 T703:PM04 T704:PM01,F,2015-05-09T14:00:04.000,0.5554010745548962,"[215.01..217.00GHz,31250.00kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,85uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [217.01..219.00GHz,31250.00kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,85uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [230.96..232.83GHz,976.56kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,88.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [232.78..234.76GHz,31250.00kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,85.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [338.63..340.61GHz,31250.00kHz,1.2mJy/beam@10km/s,91.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [340.61..342.59GHz,31250.00kHz,1.2mJy/beam@10km/s,91.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [350.73..352.72GHz,31250.00kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,114.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [352.66..354.54GHz,976.56kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,118.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",353.6000438638468,825.6593725332268,"Bower, Geoffrey","ALMA detection and astrobiological potential of vinyl cyanide on Titan ALMACAL I: First Dual-band Number Counts from a Deep and Wide ALMA Submillimeter Survey, Free from Cosmic Variance Radio and Millimeter Monitoring of Sgr A*: Spectrum, Variability, and ","Bower, Geoffrey C.

Ultimately, this study will yield the authoritative values for the CND mass and density, quantities which vary in recent literature by 3-4 orders of magnitude, and will indicate the amount of gas present in the central parsecs, and whether it will feed the central black hole or contribute to a nuclear starburst.",Circumnu_a_06_TE,"Harada, Nanase; Zhao, Jun-Hui; Morris, Mark; Wardle, Mark; Riquelme, Denise; Moser, Lydia; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Ho, Paul; Martin, Sergio; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Guesten, Rolf; Ginsburg, Adam;",4.97670122670364,0.17925214497105726,1.7591702938079834,uid://A001/X121/X2d9,uid://A001/X121/X2da,uid://A002/X9d6f4c/X29a9,The Density (and Destiny) of the Circumnuclear Disk,S,TARGET,T,8.452280352800102,1875000000.0,A002:DV16 A003:DV21 A004:DV24 A005:DV25 A013:DA51 A015:DV18 A016:DV04 A017:DA57 A018:DA63 A019:DA54 A021:DA59 A023:DV11 A024:DV10 A026:DV09 A027:DV13 A030:DA45 A031:DV08 A033:DV19 A034:DV20 A035:DA52 A037:DV12 A038:DV07 A042:DV17 A043:DA48 A044:DV15 A046:DA62 A058:DA46 A062:DV05 A066:DA64 A068:DA44 A069:DA53 A070:DA47 A071:DA50 A072:DV01 A075:DA61 A137:DA41,T,2016-06-03T23:24:48.000,0.8265484720959761,"[251.54..253.42GHz,1128.91kHz,5.6mJy/beam@10km/s,375.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [253.78..255.66GHz,1128.91kHz,5.6mJy/beam@10km/s,376.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [265.78..267.66GHz,1128.91kHz,5mJy/beam@10km/s,342.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [268.77..270.64GHz,1128.91kHz,5mJy/beam@10km/s,343.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",266.7200510751754,1250.3336721939345,"Mills, Elisabeth",,,T,,"Starbursts, star formation, Galactic centres/nuclei",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,"HCO+ (3-2), HCN (3-2)"

Although the existence of vinyl cyanide (C2H3CN) on Titan was previously inferred using Cassini mass spectrometry, a definitive detection has been lacking until now. We report the first spectroscopic detection of vinyl cyanide in Titan's atmosphere, obtained using archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), collected from February to May 2014. We detect the three strongest rotational lines of C2H3CN in the frequency range of 230 to 232 GHz, each with >4σ confidence. Radiative transfer modeling suggests that most of the C2H3CN emission originates at altitudes of ≥200 km, in agreement with recent photochemical models. The vertical column densities implied by our best-fitting models lie in the range of 3.7 × 10^13 to 1.4 × 10^14 cm-2. The corresponding production rate of vinyl cyanide and its saturation mole fraction imply the availability of sufficient dissolved material to form ~10^7 cell membranes/cm3 in Titan's sea Ligeia Mare. We have exploited ALMA calibration observations to carry out a novel, wide, and deep submillimeter (submm) survey, almacal. These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of ˜25 μJy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on ≥5σ detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S 1.2 mm ≥ 0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 μm and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2×. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs—representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies—in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution. ...(1)",2015,"Sgr A* in the Galactic Center is by now the best constrained supermassive black hole candidate. Its radio spectrum peaks at submm-waves and its size as measured with VLBI experiments shrinks with increasing frequency, exhibiting a clear size-frequency relation. The millimeter-wave emission comes from less than four Schwarzschild radii (R_S) and will allow imaging of the event horizon with mmVLBI in the future. The predicted close encounter of the G2 gas cloud in mid-2013 will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study accretion processes on scales from a few thousand to a few R_S and explore the accretion-jet coupling that may take place in Sgr A*. First discovered through NIR astrometric imaging, G2 contains at least 3 M_Earth of dusty, ionized gas that is undergoing tidal disruption and will reach periastron of 3100 R_S. The millimeter flux density will rise as gas reaches a few R_S, which could be as short as the free fall time of a few months or as long as the viscous time of years to decades. Increased accretion rates could lead to an order of magnitude increase in the flux density, which will be indicative of a new accretion-jet state that can be imaged with VLBI. The G2 encounter represents a low mass, large impact parameter analog to stellar tidal disruption events, which have recently been show to produce coupled accretion and outflow events. We request 10 epochs of band 6 and 7 flux monitoring to search for evidence of increased accretion onto Sgr A*. This proposal is part of a multi-wavelength campaign to study the G2 encounter; we have approved multi-epoch Chandra X-ray time to observe Sgr A* in 2013. Finally, the integrated data set coupled with our Cycle 0 data will provide the best-ever multi-frequency map of the gas streamers (Sgr A West) in the Galactic Center and probe for new compact structures.",Feb_SgrA_352-216_12m_C32-any,"Fragile, Patrick; Baganoff, Frederick; Maitra, Dipankar; Schaaf, Reinhold; Utomo, Dyas; Moscibrodzka, Monika; Falcke, Heino; Brunthaler, Andreas; Menten, Karl; Brinkerink, Christiaan; Markoff, Sera; Marrone, Dan; Barkats, Denis; Dexter, Jason; Impellizzeri, Violette; Peck, Alison; Gammie, Charles; Rushton, Anthony; wright, melvyn;",1.9261685487688363,0.03478723551046725,0.6981799602508545,uid://A002/X5d7935/X2fa,uid://A002/X79f8ed/X3f,uid://A002/X7b13df/Xf8a,The G2 Gas Cloud Encounter with Sagittarius A*: Accretion Structure on Scales of 3000 to 1 Schwarzschild Radii,S,TARGET WVR,T,7.234128887373411,1875000000.0,A004:DV04 A005:DV19 A007:DV23 A011:DV22 A014:DV01 A015:DV21 A016:DA62 A017:DA51 A018:DA60 A021:DA59 A024:DV13 A025:DV14 A029:DA49 A033:DV18 A038:DV24 A040:DA46 A042:DV15 A045:DA50 A046:DA48 A050:DA42 A054:DA55 A062:DV05 A063:DA54 A066:DA43 A071:DV10 A079:DA41 A138:DV17,F,2015-03-17T11:18:39.000,0.7921751976959337,"[215.01..217.00GHz,31250.00kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,90.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [217.01..219.00GHz,31250.00kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,90.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [230.96..232.83GHz,976.56kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,94.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [232.78..234.76GHz,31250.00kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,91.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [338.63..340.61GHz,31250.00kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,98uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [340.61..342.59GHz,31250.00kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,98.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [350.73..352.72GHz,31250.00kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,98.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [352.66..354.54GHz,976.56kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,152.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",353.6000219449726,825.6655414599248,"Bower, Geoffrey","ALMA detection and astrobiological potential of vinyl cyanide on Titan ALMACAL I: First Dual-band Number Counts from a Deep and Wide ALMA Submillimeter Survey, Free from Cosmic Variance Radio and Millimeter Monitoring of Sgr A*: Spectrum, Variability, and ","Bower, Geoffrey C.

We detected firstly the continuum emission at $340\:$ GHz of IRS 7 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The total flux density of IRS 7 is $S_{\, \nu} =448\pm 45\, \mu$ Jy. The flux density indicates that IRS 7 has a photosphere radius of $R=1170\pm 60\, R_{\odot }$ , which is roughly consistent with the previous Very Large Telescope Interferometer measurement. We also detected a shell-like feature with a northern extension in the H30α recombination line using ALMA. The electron temperature and electron density of the shell-like structure are estimated to be $\bar{T}^\ast _\mathrm{e}=4650\pm 500\:$ K and $\bar{n}_\mathrm{e}=(6.1\pm 0.6)\times 10^4\:$ cm $^{-3}$ , respectively. The mass loss rate is estimated to be $\dot{m}\,\, \sim 1\times 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot }\:$ yr $^{-1}$ , which is consistent with a typical mass loss rate of a pulsating red supergiant star with $M = 20$ - $25\, M_{\odot }$ . The kinematics of the ionized gas would support the hypothesis that the shell-like structure made by the mass loss of IRS 7 is supersonically traveling in the ambient matter towards the south. The brightened southern half of the structure and the northern extension would be a bow shock and a cometary-like tail structure, respectively. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is the variable radio, near-infrared (NIR), and X-ray source associated with accretion onto the Galactic center black hole. We have analyzed a comprehensive submillimeter (including new observations simultaneous with NIR monitoring), NIR, and 2-8 keV data set. Submillimeter variations tend to lag those in the NIR by ~30 minutes. An approximate Bayesian computation fit to the X-ray first-order structure function shows significantly less power at short timescales in the X-rays than in the NIR. Less X-ray variability at short timescales, combined with the observed NIR-X-ray correlations, means the variability can be described as the result of two strictly correlated stochastic processes, the X-ray process being the low-pass-filtered version of the NIR process. The NIR-X-ray linkage suggests a simple radiative model: a compact, self-absorbed synchrotron sphere with high-frequency cutoff close to NIR frequencies plus a synchrotron self-Compton scattering component at higher frequencies. This model, with parameters fit to the submillimeter, NIR, and X-ray structure functions, reproduces the observed flux densities at all wavelengths, the statistical properties of all light curves, and the time lags between bands. The fit also gives reasonable values for physical parameters such as magnetic flux density B ≍ 13 G, source size L ≍ 2.2R<SUB>S</SUB>, and high-energy electron density n<SUB>e</SUB> ≍ 4 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. An animation illustrates typical light curves, and we make public the parameter chain of our Bayesian analysis, the model implementation, and the visualization code. ...(7)",2017,"The accretion flow onto the Galactic center supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) generates a fluctuating source of e.m. radiation that has been detected at all observable wavelength domains, including radio, submillimeter, near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray. The rapid fluctuations (< 10 min) likely originate in the innermost regions of the accretion flow. Despite many attempts to clarify the correlations between the light curves at different wavelengths through observations with ground-based facilities, there is still no conclusive understanding of the variability. Recently, new pointing models have allowed the Spitzer Telescope to observe Sgr A* for continuous 24-hr periods with a S/N similar to that of ground-based, AO-supported 8-m telescopes. We have successfully organized a major multi-wavelength campaign including simultaneous 24 hr observations with both the Spitzer and Chandra space telescopes in July supplemented with observations from ground-based observatories, including the SMA.

We detected firstly the continuum emission at $340\:$ GHz of IRS 7 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The total flux density of IRS 7 is $S_{\, \nu} =448\pm 45\, \mu$ Jy. The flux density indicates that IRS 7 has a photosphere radius of $R=1170\pm 60\, R_{\odot }$ , which is roughly consistent with the previous Very Large Telescope Interferometer measurement. We also detected a shell-like feature with a northern extension in the H30α recombination line using ALMA. The electron temperature and electron density of the shell-like structure are estimated to be $\bar{T}^\ast _\mathrm{e}=4650\pm 500\:$ K and $\bar{n}_\mathrm{e}=(6.1\pm 0.6)\times 10^4\:$ cm $^{-3}$ , respectively. The mass loss rate is estimated to be $\dot{m}\,\, \sim 1\times 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot }\:$ yr $^{-1}$ , which is consistent with a typical mass loss rate of a pulsating red supergiant star with $M = 20$ - $25\, M_{\odot }$ . The kinematics of the ionized gas would support the hypothesis that the shell-like structure made by the mass loss of IRS 7 is supersonically traveling in the ambient matter towards the south. The brightened southern half of the structure and the northern extension would be a bow shock and a cometary-like tail structure, respectively. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is the variable radio, near-infrared (NIR), and X-ray source associated with accretion onto the Galactic center black hole. We have analyzed a comprehensive submillimeter (including new observations simultaneous with NIR monitoring), NIR, and 2-8 keV data set. Submillimeter variations tend to lag those in the NIR by ~30 minutes. An approximate Bayesian computation fit to the X-ray first-order structure function shows significantly less power at short timescales in the X-rays than in the NIR. Less X-ray variability at short timescales, combined with the observed NIR-X-ray correlations, means the variability can be described as the result of two strictly correlated stochastic processes, the X-ray process being the low-pass-filtered version of the NIR process. The NIR-X-ray linkage suggests a simple radiative model: a compact, self-absorbed synchrotron sphere with high-frequency cutoff close to NIR frequencies plus a synchrotron self-Compton scattering component at higher frequencies. This model, with parameters fit to the submillimeter, NIR, and X-ray structure functions, reproduces the observed flux densities at all wavelengths, the statistical properties of all light curves, and the time lags between bands. The fit also gives reasonable values for physical parameters such as magnetic flux density B ≍ 13 G, source size L ≍ 2.2R<SUB>S</SUB>, and high-energy electron density n<SUB>e</SUB> ≍ 4 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. An animation illustrates typical light curves, and we make public the parameter chain of our Bayesian analysis, the model implementation, and the visualization code. ...(7)",2017,"The accretion flow onto the Galactic center supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) generates a fluctuating source of e.m. radiation that has been detected at all observable wavelength domains, including radio, submillimeter, near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray. The rapid fluctuations (< 10 min) likely originate in the innermost regions of the accretion flow. Despite many attempts to clarify the correlations between the light curves at different wavelengths through observations with ground-based facilities, there is still no conclusive understanding of the variability. Recently, new pointing models have allowed the Spitzer Telescope to observe Sgr A* for continuous 24-hr periods with a S/N similar to that of ground-based, AO-supported 8-m telescopes. We have successfully organized a major multi-wavelength campaign including simultaneous 24 hr observations with both the Spitzer and Chandra space telescopes in July supplemented with observations from ground-based observatories, including the SMA. With this DDT proposal, we seek to include ALMA for extending the time coverage in the sub-mm, which is a particularly important wavelength regime for constraining the physics of the emitting region.",SgrA_sta_b_06_TE,"Smith, Howard; Baganoff, Frederick; Hora, Joseph; Willner, Steven; Ingalls, James; Morris, Mark; Haggard, Daryl; Carey, Sean; Marrone, Dan; Fazio, Giovanni; Ghez, Andrea; Becklin, Eric; Gammie, Charles;",0.4738556073929503,0.014990911705745154,1.5231915712356567,uid://A001/X85a/X2b,uid://A001/X85a/X2c,uid://A002/Xb58d4d/X1137,Sgr A* multi-wavelength monnitoring,S,TARGET,T,4.763216509987459,1875000000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A006:DA61 A009:DV18 A010:DV25 A013:DV20 A014:DV09 A015:DV04 A017:DV22 A023:DA51 A034:DA46 A045:DA56 A048:DV15 A061:DA62 A066:DA55 A069:DV14 A071:DA43 A072:DV05 A073:DA54 A075:DV24 A076:DA52 A077:DA58 A078:DV12 A079:DA64 A080:DV23 A081:DA53 A084:DV07 A085:DA47 A086:DV11 A087:DV10 A088:DA57 A089:DA50 A090:DV01 A091:DA63 A092:DV17 A094:DA45 A096:DA65 A097:DV03 A098:DV21 A101:DA60 A134:DA44 A135:DV19,F,2016-09-01T17:30:43.000,0.2980891233857307,"[217.44..219.31GHz,1938.48kHz,475.4uJy/beam@10km/s,29.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [219.26..221.14GHz,976.56kHz,473.9uJy/beam@10km/s,29.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.26..233.14GHz,976.56kHz,471.7uJy/beam@10km/s,30.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [233.14..235.01GHz,1938.48kHz,470.2uJy/beam@10km/s,30.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",220.20001318790952,1265.962566505961,"Witzel, Gunther",ALMA Detection of Bipolar Outflows: Evidence for Low-mass Star Formation within 1 pc of Sgr A* ALMA Detection of Extreme Blueshifted Ionized Gas within 0.2 pc of Sgr A* from −480 to −300 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> ALMA and VLA Observations: Evidence for Ongoing Low,"Royster, M.

Classical hot cores are rich in molecular emission, and they show a high abundance of complex organic molecules (COMs). The emergence of molecular complexity that is represented by COMs, in particular, is poorly constrained in the early evolution of hot cores. <BR /> Aims: We put observational constraints on the physical location of COMs in a resolved high-mass protostellar envelope associated with the G328.2551-0.5321 clump. The protostar is single down to 400 au scales and we resolved the envelope structure down to this scale. <BR /> Methods: High angular resolution observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array allowed us to resolve the structure of the inner envelope and pin down the emission region of COMs. We use local thermodynamic equilibrium modelling of the available 7.5 GHz bandwidth around 345 GHz to identify the COMs towards two accretion shocks and a selected position representing the bulk emission of the inner envelope. We quantitatively discuss the derived molecular column densities and abundances towards these positions, and use our line identification to qualitatively compare this to the emission of COMs seen towards the central position, corresponding to the protostar and its accretion disk. <BR /> Results: We detect emission from 10 COMs, and identify a line of deuterated water (HDO). In addition to methanol (CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), methyl formate (CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO) and formamide (HC(O)NH<SUB>2</SUB>) have the most extended emission. Together with HDO, these molecules are found to be associated with both the accretion shocks and the inner envelope, which has a moderate temperature of T<SUB>kin</SUB> 110 K. We find a significant difference in the distribution of COMs. O-bearing COMs, such as ethanol, acetone, and ethylene glycol are almost exclusively found and show a higher abundance towards the accretion shocks with T<SUB>kin</SUB> 180 K. Whereas N-bearing COMs with a CN group, such as vinyl and ethyl cyanide peak on the central position, thus the protostar and the accretion disk. The molecular composition is similar towards the two shock positions, while it is significantly different towards the inner envelope, suggesting an increase in abundance of O-bearing COMs towards the accretion shocks. <BR /> Conclusions: We present the first observational evidence for a large column density of COMs seen towards accretion shocks at the centrifugal barrier at the inner envelope. The overall molecular emission shows increased molecular abundances of COMs towards the accretion shocks compared to the inner envelope. The bulk of the gas from the inner envelope is still at a moderate temperature of T<SUB>kin</SUB> 110 K, and we find that the radiatively heated inner region is very compact (&lt;1000 au). Since the molecular composition is dominated by that of the accretion shocks and the radiatively heated hot inner region is very compact, we propose this source to be a precursor to a classical, radiatively heated hot core. By imaging the physical location of HDO, we find that it is consistent with an origin within the moderately heated inner envelope, suggesting that it originates from sublimation of ice from the grain surface and its destruction in the vicinity of the heating source has not been efficient yet. <P />A copy of the reduced datacubes is available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/632/A57"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/632/A57</A> ...(6)",2017,"The origin of massive stars is a fundamental open issue in modern astrophysics. Pre-ALMA interferometric studies reveal precursors to early B to late O type stars with collapsing envelopes of 15-20 Msol in 1000-3000 AU. There are exceptionally few examples known to date of more massive envelopes at these size-scales. Do massive collapsing envelopes exist within this size-scale up to the 100msol regime? Do they form the same way as the so far observed 8-20 Msol regime? To answer these questions a statistical sample is the necessary next step. Here we target a well characterized sample of massive and cold clumps above 650 Msol within 4.5 kpc identified by the ATLASGAL survey in order to reveal the most massive individual collapsing envelopes on 3000 AU size scales (with 0.6"" angular resolution). We will drastically increase the number of 20-100 Msol envelopes known to date. We also target molecular tracers to distinguish between pre-stellar and protostellar condensations allowing statistical life-time estimates for the elusive pre-stellar phase.

P.; Bergin, E.; Comito, C.; Möller, Th.","Context. Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

P.; Bergin, E.; Comito, C.; Möller, Th.","Context. Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a ""damp"" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. ...(3)",2017,"The very massive and luminous cores SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) are probably progenitors of very rich Arches-like stellar clusters in the Galactic center.

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage. ...(2)",2016,"The Galactic center uniquely provides the opportunities to resolve how the supermassive black hole accrete in inner than 5 pc scale. Our previous GBT-100m and SMA observations of molecular lines have resolved that the well-known 2-4 pc Galactic circumnuclear disk (CND) may be the convergence of several >2 pc scale molecular gas streams. The ionized mini-spiral arms in the inner ~1 pc radius further indicated that part of the molecular gas streams may penetrate inside the CND.

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time.

A.; Ivison, R. J.; Smail, I.; Biggs, A. D.","We have exploited ALMA calibration observations to carry out a novel, wide, and deep submillimeter (submm) survey, almacal. These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of ˜25 μJy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on ≥5σ detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S 1.2 mm ≥ 0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 μm and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2×. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs—representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies—in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution. We present the first determination of the abundance ratios of <SUP>13</SUP>C substitutions of cyanoacetylene (HC<SUB>3</SUB>N), [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN], in Titan's atmosphere measured using millimeter-wave spectra obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. To compare the line intensities precisely, data sets that include multiple molecular lines were extracted to suppress effects of Titan's environmental conditions and observation settings. The [HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] and [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] ratios were obtained from 12 and 1 selected data sets, respectively. As a result, nearly the uniform [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] abundance ratios of 1.17 ( ±0.20) : 1.09 ( ±0.25) : 1 (1σ) were derived, whereas previously reported ratios for the interstellar medium (ISM) have shown large anomalies that may be caused by <SUP>13</SUP>C concentrations in precursors. The result obtained here suggests that <SUP>13</SUP>C concentration processes suggested in the ISM studies do not work effectively on precursors of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N and HC<SUB>3</SUB>N themselves owing to Titan's high atmospheric temperature and/or depletion of both <SUP>13</SUP>C and <SUP>13</SUP>C+.",2016,"We wish to study the temperature structure and the reservoir of dense gas in the Galactic Center molecular cloud G0.253+0.016. This is a cloud with unique physical properties: single-dish dust emission data indicates an enormous density (2x10^5 M_sun within 3 pc radius), but the cloud is essentially devoid of signposts for star formation (i.e., IR sources, Hii regions, masers). SMA and CARMA data (submitted to ApJ) reveal that very few cores of very dense gas exist in the cloud. The requested ALMA data form part of a long-term systematic study of the Central Molecular Zone. The main aim of the current proposal is to probe the cloud's temperature structure. Line ratios indicate gas temperatures ~80K, but dust emission suggests values <30K. This difference is surprising, since the coupling of dust and gas temperatures should be efficient at the high observed densities. The high gas temperature may suppress fragmentation and therefore star formation.

These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of ˜25 μJy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on ≥5σ detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S 1.2 mm ≥ 0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 μm and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2×. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs—representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies—in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution. We present the first determination of the abundance ratios of <SUP>13</SUP>C substitutions of cyanoacetylene (HC<SUB>3</SUB>N), [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN], in Titan's atmosphere measured using millimeter-wave spectra obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. To compare the line intensities precisely, data sets that include multiple molecular lines were extracted to suppress effects of Titan's environmental conditions and observation settings. The [HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] and [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] ratios were obtained from 12 and 1 selected data sets, respectively. As a result, nearly the uniform [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] abundance ratios of 1.17 ( ±0.20) : 1.09 ( ±0.25) : 1 (1σ) were derived, whereas previously reported ratios for the interstellar medium (ISM) have shown large anomalies that may be caused by <SUP>13</SUP>C concentrations in precursors. The result obtained here suggests that <SUP>13</SUP>C concentration processes suggested in the ISM studies do not work effectively on precursors of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N and HC<SUB>3</SUB>N themselves owing to Titan's high atmospheric temperature and/or depletion of both <SUP>13</SUP>C and <SUP>13</SUP>C+.",2016,"We wish to study the temperature structure and the reservoir of dense gas in the Galactic Center molecular cloud G0.253+0.016.

SMA and CARMA data (submitted to ApJ) reveal that very few cores of very dense gas exist in the cloud. The requested ALMA data form part of a long-term systematic study of the Central Molecular Zone. The main aim of the current proposal is to probe the cloud's temperature structure. Line ratios indicate gas temperatures ~80K, but dust emission suggests values <30K. This difference is surprising, since the coupling of dust and gas temperatures should be efficient at the high observed densities. The high gas temperature may suppress fragmentation and therefore star formation.

The origins of such `supermassive' black holes (SMBHs) remain unknown1, although those of stellar-mass black holes are well understood. One possible scenario is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), which are formed by the runaway coalescence of stars in young compact star clusters2, merge at the centre of a galaxy to form a SMBH3. Although many candidates for IMBHs have been proposed, none is accepted as definitive. Recently, we discovered a peculiar molecular cloud, CO-0.40-0.22, with an extremely broad velocity width, near the centre of our Milky Way galaxy. Based on the careful analysis of gas kinematics, we concluded that a compact object with a mass of about 105M⊙ is lurking in this cloud4. Here we report the detection of a point-like continuum source as well as a compact gas clump near the centre of CO-0.40-0.22. This point-like continuum source (CO-0.40-0.22*) has a wide-band spectrum consistent with 1/500 of the Galactic SMBH (Sgr A*) in luminosity. Numerical simulations around a point-like massive object reproduce the kinematics of dense molecular gas well, which suggests that CO-0.40-0.22* is one of the most promising candidates for an intermediate-mass black hole. This paper reports a reanalysis of archival ALMA data of the high velocity(-width) compact cloud CO−0.40─0.22, which has recently been hypothesized to host an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). If beam-smearing effects, difference in beam sizes among frequency bands, and Doppler shift due to the motion of the Earth are considered accurately, none of the features reported as evidence for an IMBH in previous studies are confirmed in the reanalyzed ALMA images. Instead, through analysis of the position─velocity structure of the HCN J = 3─2 data cube, we have found kinematics typical of a cloud─cloud collision (CCC), namely, two distinct velocity components bridged by broad emission features with elevated temperatures and/or densities. One velocity component has a straight filamentary shape with approximately constant centroid velocities along its length but with a steep, V-shaped velocity gradient across its width. This contradicts the IMBH scenario but is consistent with a collision between two dissimilar-sized clouds. From a non-LTE analysis of the multitransition methanol lines, the volume density of the post-shock gas has been measured to be ≳10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>−3</SUP>, indicating that the CCC shock can compress gas in a short timescale to densities typical of star-forming regions. Evidence for star formation has not been found, possibly because the cloud is in an early phase of CCC-triggered star formation or because the collision is nonproductive.",2017,"High-velocity compact cloud (HVCC) is a peculiar population of molecular cloud found in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy with the NRO 45m telescope CO J=1-0 survey. They have compact size, extremely large velocity width, and enormous kinetic energy ranging from 1E49 to 1E52 ergs, while their driving sources are still unidentified. CO -0.40-0.22 is one of energetic HVCC (Ekin ~ 1E51 erg) with a featureless appearance. Our observations with ASTE have revealed that it has intense CO J=2-1 and HCN J=3-2 emission suggestive of high density and moderate temperature. We propose to make 7-point mosaic observations of CO -0.40-0.22 with ALMA. HCN J=3-2 and CO J=2-1 lines will be observed to obtain detailed spatial-velocity information to diagnose its kinematics: (1) rotation around a dark mass, (2) expanding shells/bubbles, or (3) supersonic collision. Cases (1) and (2) are indicative of an embedded, aged super star cluster (SSC), which could be a womb of intermediate mass black hole.

These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of ˜25 μJy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on ≥5σ detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S 1.2 mm ≥ 0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 μm and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2×. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs—representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies—in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution.

A.; Ivison, R. J.; Smail, I.; Biggs, A. D.","We have exploited ALMA calibration observations to carry out a novel, wide, and deep submillimeter (submm) survey, almacal. These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of ˜25 μJy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on ≥5σ detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S 1.2 mm ≥ 0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 μm and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2×. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs—representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies—in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution. We present the first determination of the abundance ratios of <SUP>13</SUP>C substitutions of cyanoacetylene (HC<SUB>3</SUB>N), [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN], in Titan's atmosphere measured using millimeter-wave spectra obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. To compare the line intensities precisely, data sets that include multiple molecular lines were extracted to suppress effects of Titan's environmental conditions and observation settings. The [HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] and [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] ratios were obtained from 12 and 1 selected data sets, respectively. As a result, nearly the uniform [H<SUP>13</SUP>CCCN]:[HC<SUP>13</SUP>CCN]:[HCC<SUP>13</SUP>CN] abundance ratios of 1.17 ( ±0.20) : 1.09 ( ±0.25) : 1 (1σ) were derived, whereas previously reported ratios for the interstellar medium (ISM) have shown large anomalies that may be caused by <SUP>13</SUP>C concentrations in precursors. The result obtained here suggests that <SUP>13</SUP>C concentration processes suggested in the ISM studies do not work effectively on precursors of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N and HC<SUB>3</SUB>N themselves owing to Titan's high atmospheric temperature and/or depletion of both <SUP>13</SUP>C and <SUP>13</SUP>C+.",2016,"We wish to study the temperature structure and the reservoir of dense gas in the Galactic Center molecular cloud G0.253+0.016. This is a cloud with unique physical properties: single-dish dust emission data indicates an enormous density (2x10^5 M_sun within 3 pc radius), but the cloud is essentially devoid of signposts for star formation (i.e., IR sources, Hii regions, masers). SMA and CARMA data (submitted to ApJ) reveal that very few cores of very dense gas exist in the cloud. The requested ALMA data form part of a long-term systematic study of the Central Molecular Zone. The main aim of the current proposal is to probe the cloud's temperature structure. Line ratios indicate gas temperatures ~80K, but dust emission suggests values <30K. This difference is surprising, since the coupling of dust and gas temperatures should be efficient at the high observed densities. The high gas temperature may suppress fragmentation and therefore star formation. Given cooling times of a few 10^4 yr, the dust-gas temperature difference may hint at heating in a cloud-cloud collision. A secondary goal is to detect dense cores in dust emission.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters.

We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas.

Understanding the formation and evolution of these clouds is critical for many fields in astronomy, such as star formation under extreme conditions and clouds in starbursts and the early universe. The CMZ gas is organized in a roughly edge-on ring of ~100 pc radius. The near-side, as seen from Earth, contains ALL of the dense and massive CMZ clouds, while the gas on the far-side is rather unstructured. It has been suggested that this is due to the gravitational influence of Sgr A*, which is closer to the near-side. Here we explore why the far-side does not host ANY significant cloud. Are there clouds at all, or does the far-side essentially represent an unstructured turbulent flow? If there are clouds, how ""old"" are they, based on their dynamical state?

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage.",2016,"Previous observations of hydrogen recombination lines toward the Galactic center detected ionized mini spiral arms, which appear to be material that is gravitationally accreted toward the Galactic supermassive black hole SgrA*. The new capabilities offered by Cycle 2 ALMA in band 9 allow us to probe the very hot neutral counterpart in the very central region. By observing the spatial distribution, the velocity, and the linewidth of this gas, we will determine how closely the hot neutral material can approach SgrA*, without being ionized, and to constrain the excitation conditions of this material within a ~0.1 pc radius. The optimal tracer of this material is multiple, highly-excited molecular transitions, which will better differentiate zone of different excitations, and provide more information on the kinematics of the accretion flow than observations of the hydrogen recombination line.",SgrA_sta_b_09_7M,"Minh, Young; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Hsieh, Pei-Ying; Su, Yu-Nung;",185.88197490004924,10.294356263084904,0.3918513059616089,uid://A001/X122/X40e,uid://A001/X122/X411,uid://A002/Xa6c1df/X479,Defining the Neutral Material which Survives to within 0.1 parsec of the Galactic Supermassive Black Hole,S,TARGET,T,9.136113256953054,1992187500.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06 T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,T,2016-09-25T12:01:08.000,1.1057801944412302,"[705.17..707.16GHz,3904.30kHz,185.8mJy/beam@10km/s,20.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [706.98..708.97GHz,3904.30kHz,185.9mJy/beam@10km/s,20.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [708.78..710.77GHz,3904.30kHz,186mJy/beam@10km/s,20.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [710.59..712.58GHz,3904.30kHz,199.4mJy/beam@10km/s,21.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",707.977197286044,1642.6297261126433,"Ho, Paul",Linearly polarized millimeter and submillimeter continuum emission of Sgr A* constrained by ALMA,"Liu, Hauyu Baobab",T,2016A&A...593A.107L,Galactic centres/nuclei,Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,HCN (8-7)

We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage.",2016,"Previous observations of hydrogen recombination lines toward the Galactic center detected ionized mini spiral arms, which appear to be material that is gravitationally accreted toward the Galactic supermassive black hole SgrA*. The new capabilities offered by Cycle 2 ALMA in band 9 allow us to probe the very hot neutral counterpart in the very central region. By observing the spatial distribution, the velocity, and the linewidth of this gas, we will determine how closely the hot neutral material can approach SgrA*, without being ionized, and to constrain the excitation conditions of this material within a ~0.1 pc radius. The optimal tracer of this material is multiple, highly-excited molecular transitions, which will better differentiate zone of different excitations, and provide more information on the kinematics of the accretion flow than observations of the hydrogen recombination line.",SgrA_sta_b_09_7M,"Minh, Young; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Hsieh, Pei-Ying; Su, Yu-Nung;",185.97938725912257,10.294356263084904,0.3918513059616089,uid://A001/X122/X40e,uid://A001/X122/X411,uid://A002/Xa6c1df/X479,Defining the Neutral Material which Survives to within 0.1 parsec of the Galactic Supermassive Black Hole,S,TARGET,T,9.136113256953054,1992187500.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06 T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,T,2016-09-25T12:01:08.000,1.1057801944412302,"[705.17..707.16GHz,3904.30kHz,185.8mJy/beam@10km/s,20.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [706.98..708.97GHz,3904.30kHz,185.9mJy/beam@10km/s,20.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [708.78..710.77GHz,3904.30kHz,186mJy/beam@10km/s,20.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [710.59..712.58GHz,3904.30kHz,199.4mJy/beam@10km/s,21.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",709.7771584508606,1642.6297261126433,"Ho, Paul",Linearly polarized millimeter and submillimeter continuum emission of Sgr A* constrained by ALMA,"Liu, Hauyu Baobab",T,2016A&A...593A.107L,Galactic centres/nuclei,Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,HCN (8-7)

We also develop a physical basis and empirical calibration (with 72 low-z and z ˜ 2 galaxies) for using the dust continuum as a quantitative probe of ISM masses. The galaxies with the highest star formation rates (SFRs) at &#60; z&#62; = 2.2 and 4.4 have gas masses up to 100 times that of the Milky Way and gas mass fractions reaching 50%-80%, i.e., gas masses 1-4× their stellar masses. We find a single high-z star formation law: {SFR}=35 {M}{mol}0.89× {(1+z)}z=20.95× {({sSFR})}{MS}0.23 {M}⊙ yr-1—an approximately linear dependence on the ISM mass and an increased star formation efficiency per unit gas mass at higher redshift. Galaxies above the main sequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on a timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS; thus, these “starbursts” are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses rather than an increased efficiency of converting gas to stars. At z &#62; 1, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has ˜2-5 times shorter gas depletion times than low-z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate a different mode of star formation in the early universe—most likely dynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions—a natural consequence of the high gas accretion rates. ALMA observations of the long wavelength dust continuum are used to estimate the interstellar medium (ISM) masses in a sample of 708 galaxies at z = 0.3 to 4.5 in the COSMOS field. The galaxy sample has known far-infrared luminosities and, hence, star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses ({M}* ) from the optical–infrared spectrum fitting. The galaxies sample SFRs from the main sequence (MS) to 50 times above the MS. The derived ISM masses are used to determine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, {M}* , and specific SFR (sSFR) relative to the MS. The ISM masses increase approximately with the 0.63 power of the rate of increase in SFRs with redshift and the 0.32 power of the sSFR/sSFRMS. The SF efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the SFR redshift evolution and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the MS; thus the increased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased ISM masses and SF efficiency. Using the derived ISM mass function, we estimate the accretion rates of gas required to maintain continuity of the MS evolution (&#62; 100 {M}ȯ yr‑1 at z &#62; 2.5). Simple power-law dependencies are similarly derived for the gas accretion rates. We argue that the overall evolution of galaxies is driven by the rates of gas accretion. The cosmic evolution of total ISM mass is estimated and linked to the evolution of SF and active galactic nucleus activity at early epochs. ...(4)",2016,"The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) of starforming and AGN sources cannot be probed directly from the ground or from space; their EUV are thus very poorly constrained. Our recent theoretical work demonstrates that the mm/submm recombination lines of HI and HeII are excellent probes of the EUV: they have little dust absorption, they arise from H and He (thus independent of metallicity) and their fluxes depend linearly on number of EUV continuum photons. The He++ region (producing HeII emission) requires 54 ev photons, thus the EUV hardness is directly proportional to the HeII/HI flux ratio. We propose observations of HI and HeII in compact OB star regions and galactic nuclei (SgrA* and NGC 1068). These observations will demonstrate the potential of the HI and HeII lines -- opening a new observing window on the EUV. Themeasured hardness of the EUV spectra will provide critical input to starburstsynthesis models. Based on prior near infrared line detections, we confidently expect expect detectios of the line emission in both SgrA* and NGC 1068.

We also develop a physical basis and empirical calibration (with 72 low-z and z ˜ 2 galaxies) for using the dust continuum as a quantitative probe of ISM masses. The galaxies with the highest star formation rates (SFRs) at &#60; z&#62; = 2.2 and 4.4 have gas masses up to 100 times that of the Milky Way and gas mass fractions reaching 50%-80%, i.e., gas masses 1-4× their stellar masses. We find a single high-z star formation law: {SFR}=35 {M}{mol}0.89× {(1+z)}z=20.95× {({sSFR})}{MS}0.23 {M}⊙ yr-1—an approximately linear dependence on the ISM mass and an increased star formation efficiency per unit gas mass at higher redshift. Galaxies above the main sequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on a timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS; thus, these “starbursts” are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses rather than an increased efficiency of converting gas to stars. At z &#62; 1, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has ˜2-5 times shorter gas depletion times than low-z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate a different mode of star formation in the early universe—most likely dynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions—a natural consequence of the high gas accretion rates. ALMA observations of the long wavelength dust continuum are used to estimate the interstellar medium (ISM) masses in a sample of 708 galaxies at z = 0.3 to 4.5 in the COSMOS field. The galaxy sample has known far-infrared luminosities and, hence, star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses ({M}* ) from the optical–infrared spectrum fitting. The galaxies sample SFRs from the main sequence (MS) to 50 times above the MS. The derived ISM masses are used to determine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, {M}* , and specific SFR (sSFR) relative to the MS. The ISM masses increase approximately with the 0.63 power of the rate of increase in SFRs with redshift and the 0.32 power of the sSFR/sSFRMS. The SF efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the SFR redshift evolution and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the MS; thus the increased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased ISM masses and SF efficiency. Using the derived ISM mass function, we estimate the accretion rates of gas required to maintain continuity of the MS evolution (&#62; 100 {M}ȯ yr‑1 at z &#62; 2.5). Simple power-law dependencies are similarly derived for the gas accretion rates. We argue that the overall evolution of galaxies is driven by the rates of gas accretion. The cosmic evolution of total ISM mass is estimated and linked to the evolution of SF and active galactic nucleus activity at early epochs. ...(4)",2016,"The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) of starforming and AGN sources cannot be probed directly from the ground or from space; their EUV are thus very poorly constrained. Our recent theoretical work demonstrates that the mm/submm recombination lines of HI and HeII are excellent probes of the EUV: they have little dust absorption, they arise from H and He (thus independent of metallicity) and their fluxes depend linearly on number of EUV continuum photons. The He++ region (producing HeII emission) requires 54 ev photons, thus the EUV hardness is directly proportional to the HeII/HI flux ratio. We propose observations of HI and HeII in compact OB star regions and galactic nuclei (SgrA* and NGC 1068). These observations will demonstrate the potential of the HI and HeII lines -- opening a new observing window on the EUV. Themeasured hardness of the EUV spectra will provide critical input to starburstsynthesis models. Based on prior near infrared line detections, we confidently expect expect detectios of the line emission in both SgrA* and NGC 1068.

In particular, cloud-cloud collision initiated by the bar-driven inflow of molecular clouds or by feedback from past active star formation may be efficient formation process of stellar clusters cluster. Recently we detected a peculiar molecular clump not associated with major star forming GMC complexes. The clump CO-0.30-0.7 has a extremely large velocity width of 120 km/s, indicating that the entire clump is disturbed by shock possibly caused by interaction with an adjacent large expanding shell. Interestingly, the clump also has a compact core of 300-500 solar masses with narrow line width (20 km/s), which is virialized and hence capable of forming stars. At present no sign of star formation is detected toward the clump, and we speculate this is a region where cloud-cloud collision has just started, which may possibly lead cluster formation, or destruction of cloud cores.

An intermittent jet likely formed this channel and is consistent with earlier evidence of a sustained, Seyfert-level outburst fueled by black hole accretion onto Sgr A* several Myr ago. Therefore, to trace a now weak jet that perhaps penetrated, deflected, and percolated along multiple paths through the interstellar medium, relevant interactions are identified and quantified in archival X-ray images, Hubble Space Telescope Paschen α images and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array millimeter-wave spectra, and new SOAR telescope IR spectra. Hydrodynamical simulations are used to show how a nuclear jet can explain these structures and inflate the ROSAT/eROSITA X-ray and Fermi γ-ray bubbles that extend ± 75° from the Galactic plane. Thus, our Galactic outflow has features in common with energetic, jet-driven structures in the prototypical Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The Galactic center 50 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> molecular cloud (50MC) is the most remarkable molecular cloud in the Sagittarius A region. This cloud is a candidate for the massive star formation induced by cloud─cloud collision (CCC) with a collision velocity of ∼30 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> that is estimated from the velocity dispersion. We observed the whole of the 50MC with a high angular resolution (∼2.″0 × 1.″4) in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array cycle 1 in the H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 and C<SUP>34</SUP>S J = 2−1 emission lines. We identified 241 and 129 bound cores with a virial parameter of less than 2, which are thought to be gravitationally bound, in the H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUP>34</SUP>S maps using the clumpfind algorithm, respectively. In the CCC region, the bound H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUP>34</SUP>S cores are 119 and 82, whose masses are 68% and 76% of those in the whole 50MC, respectively. The distribution of the core number and column densities in the CCC are biased to larger densities than those in the non-CCC region. The distributions indicate that the CCC compresses the molecular gas and increases the number of the dense bound cores. Additionally, the massive bound cores with masses of &gt;3000 M <SUB>☉</SUB> exist only in the CCC region, although the slope of the core mass function (CMF) in the CCC region is not different from that in the non-CCC region. We conclude that the compression by the CCC efficiently formed massive bound cores even if the slope of the CMF is not changed so much by the CCC. ...(6)",2016,"In recent two decades, the young and highly luminous clusters in the Galactic center region, including Arches cluster, Quintuplet cluster, and Central cluster have been found by IR observations. The molecular clouds in the region are much denser, warmer, and more turbulent than disk molecular clouds. They are presumably the cradles of these bright star clusters. It is, however, an open question as to what mechanism is responsible for the formation of such star clusters in the cloud. The Galactic center 50 km s-1 molecular cloud is a most promising test bed to study of the star formation mechanism in the region. The core mass function of the clouds (CMF) is believed to be important for diagnosis of the star formation even in the Galactic center region. We propose multi-spices (CS, C34S, C33S, thermal SiO, H13CO+ and H42α) and wide-field imaging observations covering the whole cloud with mosaic method using ALMA to derive the CMF and size spectrum and to examine their positional deference in the cloud.

One of the molecular clouds is positionally connected to part of the CND adjacent to the ""western arc."" However, the cloud is seen to rotate in the opposite direction to the CND, so it could currently be falling from the outer region to the CND and being disrupted by the tidal shear of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) because the velocity is not yet assimilated into that of the CND.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. We present an overview of the CMZoom survey and its first data release. CMZoom is the first blind, high-resolution survey of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; the inner 500 pc of the Milky Way) at wavelengths sensitive to the pre-cursors of high-mass stars. CMZoom is a 550 hr Large Program on the Submillimeter Array that mapped at 1.3 mm all of the gas and dust in the CMZ above a molecular hydrogen column density of 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at a resolution of ∼3″ (0.1 pc). In this paper, we focus on the 1.3 mm dust continuum and its data release, but also describe CMZoom spectral line data which will be released in a forthcoming publication. While CMZoom detected many regions with rich and complex substructure, its key result is an overall deficit in compact substructures on 0.1-2 pc scales (the compact dense gas fraction: CDGF). In comparison with clouds in the Galactic disk, the CDGF in the CMZ is substantially lower, despite having much higher average column densities. CMZ clouds with high CDGFs are well-known sites of active star formation. The inability of most gas in the CMZ to form compact substructures is likely responsible for the dearth of star formation in the CMZ, surprising considering its high density. The factors responsible for the low CDGF are not yet understood but are plausibly due to the extreme environment of the CMZ, having far-reaching ramifications for our understanding of the star formation process across the cosmos. ...(1)",2019,"The ultimate goal of star formation (SF) studies is an end-to-end understanding of stellar mass assembly as a function of environment. Existing observations have two fundamental limitations reaching this goal: they predominantly focus on regions in similar environments, and observations of a region only provides a single evolutionary snapshot. This proposal aims to overcome both these problems by exploiting a causally-related system of clouds in the extreme environment of the Galactic Centre. ALMA observations will allow us to test whether SF has been triggered in these clouds by close passage to the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential. If confirmed, this will provide a laboratory for studying stellar mass assembly as a function of absolute time, allowing us to: (i) directly test theoretical predictions of molecular cloud structure evolution in turbulent clouds; (ii) unambiguously determine how critical density thresholds for SF vary with environment; (iii) follow the mass assembly of gravitationally bound cores, including likely precursors to stars >100 Msun, thereby directly testing SF theories at the most extreme mass ranges.",Clouds_E_a_06_TE,"Alves, Joao; Molinari, Sergio; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Bonnell, Ian; Rathborne, Jill; Ginsburg, Adam; Beltran, Maite; Walker, Daniel; Gomez, Laura; Walsh, Andrew; Hill, Tracey; Mills, Elisabeth; Peters, Thomas; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Kainulainen, Jouni; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; Chrysostomou, Antonio; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett;",7.977062599307314,0.2762646357279108,3.976219415664673,uid://A001/X197/Xb6,uid://A001/X197/Xb7,uid://A002/X9f2ff8/X11bd,"Extreme Star Formation ""The Movie"": the early assembly of monster stars and clusters caught in action",S,TARGET,T,9.44358423997806,1875000000.0,A001:DA58 A002:DV16 A004:DV24 A005:DV25 A010:DV02 A013:DA51 A015:DV18 A016:DV04 A017:DA57 A018:DA63 A019:DA54 A021:DA59 A023:DV11 A024:DV10 A027:DV13 A029:DA49 A030:DA45 A031:DV08 A033:DV19 A034:DV20 A036:DA60 A037:DV12 A038:DV07 A040:DA43 A042:DV17 A044:DV15 A046:DA62 A050:DV14 A058:DA46 A060:DA55 A062:DV05 A066:DA64 A067:DV21 A068:DA44 A069:DA53 A070:DA47 A071:DA50 A075:DA61 A137:DA41,T,2017-08-05T00:00:00.000,0.8593939594719865,"[249.56..251.44GHz,1128.91kHz,8.3mJy/beam@10km/s,555.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [251.56..253.44GHz,1128.91kHz,8.1mJy/beam@10km/s,544.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [264.56..266.44GHz,1128.91kHz,8mJy/beam@10km/s,548.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [266.56..268.44GHz,1128.91kHz,8.2mJy/beam@10km/s,562.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",265.49987610549704,1260.629068905023,"Longmore, Steven",CMZoom.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. We present an overview of the CMZoom survey and its first data release. CMZoom is the first blind, high-resolution survey of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; the inner 500 pc of the Milky Way) at wavelengths sensitive to the pre-cursors of high-mass stars. CMZoom is a 550 hr Large Program on the Submillimeter Array that mapped at 1.3 mm all of the gas and dust in the CMZ above a molecular hydrogen column density of 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at a resolution of ∼3″ (0.1 pc). In this paper, we focus on the 1.3 mm dust continuum and its data release, but also describe CMZoom spectral line data which will be released in a forthcoming publication. While CMZoom detected many regions with rich and complex substructure, its key result is an overall deficit in compact substructures on 0.1-2 pc scales (the compact dense gas fraction: CDGF). In comparison with clouds in the Galactic disk, the CDGF in the CMZ is substantially lower, despite having much higher average column densities. CMZ clouds with high CDGFs are well-known sites of active star formation. The inability of most gas in the CMZ to form compact substructures is likely responsible for the dearth of star formation in the CMZ, surprising considering its high density. The factors responsible for the low CDGF are not yet understood but are plausibly due to the extreme environment of the CMZ, having far-reaching ramifications for our understanding of the star formation process across the cosmos. ...(1)",2019,"The ultimate goal of star formation (SF) studies is an end-to-end understanding of stellar mass assembly as a function of environment. Existing observations have two fundamental limitations reaching this goal: they predominantly focus on regions in similar environments, and observations of a region only provides a single evolutionary snapshot. This proposal aims to overcome both these problems by exploiting a causally-related system of clouds in the extreme environment of the Galactic Centre. ALMA observations will allow us to test whether SF has been triggered in these clouds by close passage to the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential. If confirmed, this will provide a laboratory for studying stellar mass assembly as a function of absolute time, allowing us to: (i) directly test theoretical predictions of molecular cloud structure evolution in turbulent clouds; (ii) unambiguously determine how critical density thresholds for SF vary with environment; (iii) follow the mass assembly of gravitationally bound cores, including likely precursors to stars >100 Msun, thereby directly testing SF theories at the most extreme mass ranges.",Cloud_D_a_06_TE,"Alves, Joao; Molinari, Sergio; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Bonnell, Ian; Rathborne, Jill; Ginsburg, Adam; Beltran, Maite; Walker, Daniel; Gomez, Laura; Walsh, Andrew; Hill, Tracey; Mills, Elisabeth; Peters, Thomas; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Kainulainen, Jouni; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; Chrysostomou, Antonio; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett;",8.74314299538857,0.3013330112656591,3.8073792457580566,uid://A001/X197/Xc0,uid://A001/X197/Xc1,uid://A002/X9f2ff8/X1b63,"Extreme Star Formation ""The Movie"": the early assembly of monster stars and clusters caught in action",S,TARGET,T,10.432078890298452,1875000000.0,A001:DA58 A002:DV16 A004:DV24 A005:DV25 A010:DV02 A013:DA51 A015:DV18 A016:DV04 A017:DA57 A018:DA63 A019:DA54 A021:DA59 A023:DV11 A024:DV10 A027:DV13 A029:DA49 A030:DA45 A031:DV08 A033:DV19 A034:DV20 A036:DA60 A037:DV12 A038:DV07 A040:DA43 A042:DV17 A044:DV15 A046:DA62 A050:DV14 A060:DA55 A062:DV05 A066:DA64 A067:DV21 A068:DA44 A069:DA53 A070:DA47 A071:DA50 A075:DA61 A137:DA41,T,2017-08-05T00:00:00.000,0.8956711747730559,"[249.56..251.44GHz,1128.91kHz,9.2mJy/beam@10km/s,612.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [251.56..253.44GHz,1128.91kHz,8.9mJy/beam@10km/s,596.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [264.56..266.44GHz,1128.91kHz,8.7mJy/beam@10km/s,600.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [266.56..268.44GHz,1128.91kHz,8.7mJy/beam@10km/s,601.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",265.49989484195896,1260.6310307336107,"Longmore, Steven",CMZoom.

Our data comprise eight individual pointings, with significant SiO (8<SUB>7</SUB>-7<SUB>6</SUB>) and SO (7-6) emission detected toward 98 positions within these pointings. Additionally, we identify H<SUB>2</SUB>CS (9<SUB>1,9</SUB>-8<SUB>1,8</SUB>), OCS (25-24), and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH (2<SUB>1,1</SUB>-2<SUB>0,2</SUB>) toward a smaller subset of positions. By using the observed peak line flux density, together with a Bayesian inference technique informed by radiative transfer models, we systematically recover the physical gas conditions toward each of these positions. We estimate that the bulk of the surveyed gas has temperature T<SUB>kin</SUB> &lt; 500 K and density n<SUB>H</SUB> ⪅ 10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, consistent with previous studies of similar positions as traced by HCN clumps.

Furthermore, we qualitatively note that the observed chemical enrichment across large scales within the CND is consistent with bulk grain processing, though multiple desorption mechanisms are plausibly responsible.

We aim to firmly establish that these lines are indeed tracers of on-going star formation between 0.2 and 6 pc from Sgr A* in the orbiting molecular ring and its interior. This will be achieved by resolving the SiO (5-4), (7-6) and (2-1) line emission from protostellar outflow candidates and demonstrating the kinematics and morphology of jet driven outflows. In addition, we will search for continuum sources at the center of protostellar outflow candidates to determine whether they have a dust spectrum.

Our data comprise eight individual pointings, with significant SiO (8<SUB>7</SUB>-7<SUB>6</SUB>) and SO (7-6) emission detected toward 98 positions within these pointings. Additionally, we identify H<SUB>2</SUB>CS (9<SUB>1,9</SUB>-8<SUB>1,8</SUB>), OCS (25-24), and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH (2<SUB>1,1</SUB>-2<SUB>0,2</SUB>) toward a smaller subset of positions. By using the observed peak line flux density, together with a Bayesian inference technique informed by radiative transfer models, we systematically recover the physical gas conditions toward each of these positions. We estimate that the bulk of the surveyed gas has temperature T<SUB>kin</SUB> &lt; 500 K and density n<SUB>H</SUB> ⪅ 10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, consistent with previous studies of similar positions as traced by HCN clumps. However, we identify an uncharacteristically hot (T<SUB>kin</SUB> ≍ 600 K) and dense (n<SUB>H</SUB> ≍ 10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) source in the Northeastern Arm. This position is found to be approximately consistent with a gravitationally bound region dominated by turbulence. We also identify a nearby cold (T<SUB>kin</SUB> ≍ 60 K) and extremely dense (n<SUB>H</SUB> ≍ 10<SUP>7</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) position that is again potentially bound and dominated by turbulence. We also determine that the total gas mass contained within the CND is M<SUB>CND</SUB> ≲ 4 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Furthermore, we qualitatively note that the observed chemical enrichment across large scales within the CND is consistent with bulk grain processing, though multiple desorption mechanisms are plausibly responsible. Further chemical modeling is required to identify the physical origin of the grain processing, as well as the localized H<SUB>2</SUB>CS and OCS emission.",2021,"Recent ALMA, CARMA, SMA, VLA and GBT observations of the Galactic center show highly excited SiO (5-4) and (2-1) line emission as well as methanol and water masers within 2' of Sgr A*. These emission lines are considered to be excellent indicators of on-going star formation activity. We aim to firmly establish that these lines are indeed tracers of on-going star formation between 0.2 and 6 pc from Sgr A* in the orbiting molecular ring and its interior. This will be achieved by resolving the SiO (5-4), (7-6) and (2-1) line emission from protostellar outflow candidates and demonstrating the kinematics and morphology of jet driven outflows. In addition, we will search for continuum sources at the center of protostellar outflow candidates to determine whether they have a dust spectrum. This ALMA study of the molecular ring and its interior will pin down the star formation hypothesis and will be able to distinguish between clump-clump collisions versus on-going star formation within the inner 6 pc of Sgr A*.",Circumnu_a_03_TE,"Royster, Marc; Roberts, Doug; Martin, Sergio; Wardle, Mark; Wootten, Al; Lis, Dariusz;",4.188353856948189,0.21063880646432717,4.186551570892334,uid://A001/X197/X26,uid://A001/X197/X27,uid://A002/Xa77ec0/X3ec,SiO Observations of the Circumnuclear Molecular Ring and Its Interior,S,TARGET,T,5.600767063063809,234375000.0,A007:DV09 A008:DV08 A011:DV04 A014:DV06 A015:DV18 A021:DA59 A029:DA49 A058:DA46 A060:DA55 A064:DA50 A069:DA53 A072:DV01 A073:DA63 A075:DA61 A076:DV13 A077:DV16 A078:DV15 A079:DA43 A080:DV24 A082:DA42 A083:DV25 A084:DV05 A085:DA51 A086:DV14 A087:DV23 A088:DV20 A089:DA60 A091:DA58 A092:DV12 A093:DV21 A094:DV02 A096:DV10 A097:DA62 A101:DA47 A104:DA44 A105:DA52 A107:DA64 A110:DV22 A112:DV07 A113:DA57 A115:DV11 A135:DA45 A136:DV17 A137:DA41,T,2016-12-07T03:25:36.000,0.4970581361597017,"[84.40..84.64GHz,141.11kHz,4.2mJy/beam@10km/s,465.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.73..86.96GHz,141.11kHz,4.2mJy/beam@10km/s,465.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [96.51..96.97GHz,282.23kHz,4mJy/beam@10km/s,329.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.61..99.85GHz,141.11kHz,4.1mJy/beam@10km/s,492.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",86.84695897850395,423.70616733237006,"Yusef-Zadeh, Farhad",Revealing the Physical Conditions around Sgr A* Using Bayesian Inference.

Gerin, M.; Liszt, H.; Neufeld, D.; Godard, B.; Sonnentrucker, P.; Pety, J.; Roueff, E.","<BR /> Aims: The transition between atomic and molecular hydrogen is associated with important changes in the structure of interstellar clouds, and marks the beginning of interstellar chemistry. Most molecular ions are rapidly formed (in ion-molecule reactions) and destroyed (by dissociative recombination) in the diffuse ISM. Because of the relatively simple networks controlling their abundances, molecular ions are usually good probes of the underlying physical conditions including, for instance the fraction of gas in molecular form or the fractional ionization. In this paper we focus on three possible probes of the molecular hydrogen column density, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP>. <BR /> Methods: We presented high-sensitivity ALMA absorption data toward a sample of compact H II regions and bright QSOs with prominent foreground absorption, in the ground-state transitions of the molecular ions HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> and the neutral species HCN and HNC, and from the excited-state transitions of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(4-3) and <SUP>13</SUP>CS(2-1). These data are compared with Herschel absorption spectra of the ground-state transition of HF and p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O. <BR /> Results: We show that the HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> column densities are well correlated with each other. HCO<SUP>+</SUP> and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> are tightly correlated with p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O, while they exhibit a different correlation pattern with HF depending on whether the absorbing matter is located in the Galactic disk or in the central molecular zone.

Most molecular ions are rapidly formed (in ion-molecule reactions) and destroyed (by dissociative recombination) in the diffuse ISM. Because of the relatively simple networks controlling their abundances, molecular ions are usually good probes of the underlying physical conditions including, for instance the fraction of gas in molecular form or the fractional ionization. In this paper we focus on three possible probes of the molecular hydrogen column density, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP>. <BR /> Methods: We presented high-sensitivity ALMA absorption data toward a sample of compact H II regions and bright QSOs with prominent foreground absorption, in the ground-state transitions of the molecular ions HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> and the neutral species HCN and HNC, and from the excited-state transitions of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(4-3) and <SUP>13</SUP>CS(2-1). These data are compared with Herschel absorption spectra of the ground-state transition of HF and p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O. <BR /> Results: We show that the HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> column densities are well correlated with each other.

Most molecular ions are rapidly formed (in ion-molecule reactions) and destroyed (by dissociative recombination) in the diffuse ISM. Because of the relatively simple networks controlling their abundances, molecular ions are usually good probes of the underlying physical conditions including, for instance the fraction of gas in molecular form or the fractional ionization. In this paper we focus on three possible probes of the molecular hydrogen column density, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP>. <BR /> Methods: We presented high-sensitivity ALMA absorption data toward a sample of compact H II regions and bright QSOs with prominent foreground absorption, in the ground-state transitions of the molecular ions HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> and the neutral species HCN and HNC, and from the excited-state transitions of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(4-3) and <SUP>13</SUP>CS(2-1). These data are compared with Herschel absorption spectra of the ground-state transition of HF and p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O. <BR /> Results: We show that the HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> column densities are well correlated with each other. HCO<SUP>+</SUP> and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> are tightly correlated with p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O, while they exhibit a different correlation pattern with HF depending on whether the absorbing matter is located in the Galactic disk or in the central molecular zone. We report new detections of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> confirming that this ion is ubiquitous in the diffuse matter, with an abundance relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> of 7 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: We confirm that the CF<SUP>+</SUP> abundance is lower than predicted by simple chemical models and propose that the rate of the main formation reaction is lower by a factor of about 3 than usually assumed. In the absence of CH or HF data, we recommend to use the ground-state transitions of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, CCH, and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> to trace diffuse molecular hydrogen, with mean abundances relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> of 3 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>, 4 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP>, and 4 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>, respectively, leading to sensitivity N(H<SUB>2</SUB>)/ ∫ τdv of 4 × 10<SUP>20</SUP>, 1.5 × 10<SUP>21</SUP>, and 6 × 10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> /km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively.

Most molecular ions are rapidly formed (in ion-molecule reactions) and destroyed (by dissociative recombination) in the diffuse ISM. Because of the relatively simple networks controlling their abundances, molecular ions are usually good probes of the underlying physical conditions including, for instance the fraction of gas in molecular form or the fractional ionization. In this paper we focus on three possible probes of the molecular hydrogen column density, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP>. <BR /> Methods: We presented high-sensitivity ALMA absorption data toward a sample of compact H II regions and bright QSOs with prominent foreground absorption, in the ground-state transitions of the molecular ions HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> and the neutral species HCN and HNC, and from the excited-state transitions of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(4-3) and <SUP>13</SUP>CS(2-1). These data are compared with Herschel absorption spectra of the ground-state transition of HF and p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O. <BR /> Results: We show that the HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> column densities are well correlated with each other. HCO<SUP>+</SUP> and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> are tightly correlated with p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O, while they exhibit a different correlation pattern with HF depending on whether the absorbing matter is located in the Galactic disk or in the central molecular zone. We report new detections of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> confirming that this ion is ubiquitous in the diffuse matter, with an abundance relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> of 7 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: We confirm that the CF<SUP>+</SUP> abundance is lower than predicted by simple chemical models and propose that the rate of the main formation reaction is lower by a factor of about 3 than usually assumed. In the absence of CH or HF data, we recommend to use the ground-state transitions of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, CCH, and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> to trace diffuse molecular hydrogen, with mean abundances relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> of 3 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>, 4 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP>, and 4 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>, respectively, leading to sensitivity N(H<SUB>2</SUB>)/ ∫ τdv of 4 × 10<SUP>20</SUP>, 1.5 × 10<SUP>21</SUP>, and 6 × 10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> /km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively.

Most molecular ions are rapidly formed (in ion-molecule reactions) and destroyed (by dissociative recombination) in the diffuse ISM. Because of the relatively simple networks controlling their abundances, molecular ions are usually good probes of the underlying physical conditions including, for instance the fraction of gas in molecular form or the fractional ionization. In this paper we focus on three possible probes of the molecular hydrogen column density, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP>. <BR /> Methods: We presented high-sensitivity ALMA absorption data toward a sample of compact H II regions and bright QSOs with prominent foreground absorption, in the ground-state transitions of the molecular ions HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> and the neutral species HCN and HNC, and from the excited-state transitions of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(4-3) and <SUP>13</SUP>CS(2-1). These data are compared with Herschel absorption spectra of the ground-state transition of HF and p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O. <BR /> Results: We show that the HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HOC<SUP>+</SUP>, and CF<SUP>+</SUP> column densities are well correlated with each other. HCO<SUP>+</SUP> and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> are tightly correlated with p-H<SUB>2</SUB>O, while they exhibit a different correlation pattern with HF depending on whether the absorbing matter is located in the Galactic disk or in the central molecular zone. We report new detections of C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> confirming that this ion is ubiquitous in the diffuse matter, with an abundance relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> of 7 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: We confirm that the CF<SUP>+</SUP> abundance is lower than predicted by simple chemical models and propose that the rate of the main formation reaction is lower by a factor of about 3 than usually assumed. In the absence of CH or HF data, we recommend to use the ground-state transitions of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, CCH, and HOC<SUP>+</SUP> to trace diffuse molecular hydrogen, with mean abundances relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> of 3 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>, 4 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP>, and 4 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>, respectively, leading to sensitivity N(H<SUB>2</SUB>)/ ∫ τdv of 4 × 10<SUP>20</SUP>, 1.5 × 10<SUP>21</SUP>, and 6 × 10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> /km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. The fraction of stars forming in compact, gravitationally bound clusters (the “cluster formation efficiency” (CFE)) is an important quantity for deriving the spatial clustering of stellar feedback and for tracing star formation using stellar clusters across the universe. Observations of clusters in nearby galaxies have revealed a strong dependence of the CFE on the local gas density, indicating that more stars form in star clusters when the star formation rate surface density is higher. Previously, it has not been possible to test this relation at very young ages and in clusters with individual stars resolved due to the universally low densities in the cluster-forming regions in the Local Group. This has even led to the suggestion that the CFE increases with distance from the Sun, which would suggest an observational bias. However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_TP,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",27.95034064579513,0.5194349368710425,4.389588832855225,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X147/X92,uid://A002/X9a755e/X1f06,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,TARGET WVR,T,966.9477008976131,1992187500.0,A072:DV01 T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,F,2017-01-13T21:39:57.000,54.55125132267276,"[88.48..90.47GHz,488.28kHz,28mJy/beam@10km/s,1.1mJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.29..92.28GHz,488.28kHz,26.2mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.37..102.36GHz,488.28kHz,24.9mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.23..104.22GHz,488.28kHz,24.7mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX]",89.4784985332025,1404.3678052678852,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

However, the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way hosts clouds with densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Local Group. We report a measurement of the CFE in the highest-density region in the Galaxy, Sgr B2, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of high-mass young stellar objects. We find that over a third of the stars (37 ± 7%) in Sgr B2 are forming in bound clusters. This value is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent models for the CFE and is inconsistent with a constant CFE in the Galaxy. ...(1)",2018,"Sgr B2, a high-mass molecular cloud in our Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone, is the most extreme site of ongoing star formation in the Local Group in terms of its gas content, temperature, and velocity dispersion. If any cloud in our galaxy is analogous to the typical cloud at the universal peak of star formation at z~2, this is it. We propose a 6'x6' mosaic in the 3mm window targeting gas thermometer lines, specifically CH3CN and its isotopologues. We will measure the velocity dispersion and temperature of the molecular gas on all scales (0.02 - 12 pc, 0.5"" - 5') within the cloud, which will yield resolved measurements of the Mach number and the sonic scale of the gas. We will assess the relative importance of stellar feedback and turbulence on the star-forming gas, determining how extensive the feedback effects are within an ultradense environment. The observations will provide constraints on the inputs to star formation theories and will determine their applicability in extremely dense, turbulent, and hot regions. Sgr B2 will be used as a testing ground for star formation theories in an environment analogous to high-z starburst clouds in which they must be applied.",SgrB2_a_03_TP,"Remijan, Anthony; Alves, Joao; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Brogan, Crystal; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik; Darling, Jeremy; Johnston, Katharine; Beuther, Henrik; Schilke, Peter; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Lang, Cornelia; Hunter, Todd; Rosolowsky, Erik; Wilner, David; Longmore, Steven; Schmiedeke, Anika; Jimenez-Serra, Izaskun; Walsh, Andrew; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ott, Juergen; Testi, Leonardo; De Pree, Christopher; Pineda, Jaime; Corby, Joanna; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate;",26.193806550455797,0.5194349368710425,4.389588832855225,uid://A001/X121/X4b7,uid://A001/X147/X92,uid://A002/X9a755e/X1f06,Sgr B2 - The Proving Ground for Star Formation Theories,S,TARGET WVR,T,966.9477008976131,1992187500.0,A072:DV01 T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,F,2017-01-13T21:39:57.000,54.55125132267276,"[88.48..90.47GHz,488.28kHz,28mJy/beam@10km/s,1.1mJy/beam@native, XX] U [90.29..92.28GHz,488.28kHz,26.2mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.37..102.36GHz,488.28kHz,24.9mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX] U [102.23..104.22GHz,488.28kHz,24.7mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX]",91.28268763639178,1404.3678052678852,"Ginsburg, Adam",A High Cluster Formation Efficiency in the Sagittarius B2 Complex CMZoom.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. We present an overview of the CMZoom survey and its first data release. CMZoom is the first blind, high-resolution survey of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; the inner 500 pc of the Milky Way) at wavelengths sensitive to the pre-cursors of high-mass stars.

In this paper, we focus on the 1.3 mm dust continuum and its data release, but also describe CMZoom spectral line data which will be released in a forthcoming publication. While CMZoom detected many regions with rich and complex substructure, its key result is an overall deficit in compact substructures on 0.1-2 pc scales (the compact dense gas fraction: CDGF). In comparison with clouds in the Galactic disk, the CDGF in the CMZ is substantially lower, despite having much higher average column densities. CMZ clouds with high CDGFs are well-known sites of active star formation. The inability of most gas in the CMZ to form compact substructures is likely responsible for the dearth of star formation in the CMZ, surprising considering its high density. The factors responsible for the low CDGF are not yet understood but are plausibly due to the extreme environment of the CMZ, having far-reaching ramifications for our understanding of the star formation process across the cosmos. ...(1)",2019,"The ultimate goal of star formation (SF) studies is an end-to-end understanding of stellar mass assembly as a function of environment.

CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ∼99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center. We present an overview of the CMZoom survey and its first data release. CMZoom is the first blind, high-resolution survey of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; the inner 500 pc of the Milky Way) at wavelengths sensitive to the pre-cursors of high-mass stars. CMZoom is a 550 hr Large Program on the Submillimeter Array that mapped at 1.3 mm all of the gas and dust in the CMZ above a molecular hydrogen column density of 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at a resolution of ∼3″ (0.1 pc). In this paper, we focus on the 1.3 mm dust continuum and its data release, but also describe CMZoom spectral line data which will be released in a forthcoming publication. While CMZoom detected many regions with rich and complex substructure, its key result is an overall deficit in compact substructures on 0.1-2 pc scales (the compact dense gas fraction: CDGF). In comparison with clouds in the Galactic disk, the CDGF in the CMZ is substantially lower, despite having much higher average column densities. CMZ clouds with high CDGFs are well-known sites of active star formation. The inability of most gas in the CMZ to form compact substructures is likely responsible for the dearth of star formation in the CMZ, surprising considering its high density. The factors responsible for the low CDGF are not yet understood but are plausibly due to the extreme environment of the CMZ, having far-reaching ramifications for our understanding of the star formation process across the cosmos. ...(1)",2019,"The ultimate goal of star formation (SF) studies is an end-to-end understanding of stellar mass assembly as a function of environment.

We apply the two standard orbit models, spirals vs. ellipses, invoked to explain the kinematics of the ionized gas streamers around Sgr A<SUP>*</SUP>. The location and velocities of the <SUP>12</SUP>CO cloudlets inside the cavity are inconsistent with the spiral model, and only two of them are consistent with the Keplerian ellipse model. Most cloudlets, however, show similar velocities that are incompatible with the motions of the ionized streamers or with gas bounded to the central gravity. We speculate that they are leftovers of more massive molecular clouds that fall into the cavity and are tidally disrupted, or that they originate from instabilities in the inner rim of the CND that lead to fragmentation and infall from there.

A massive dense clump precursor must be assembled and kept stable against fragmentation long enough to form massive stars; on the other hand a strong triggering mechanism must be available to justify the formation of a cluster with a top-heavy IMF. The recent discovery of a 100-pc ring of dense and cold clouds orbiting around the Galactic Center (Molinari et al. 2011) may provide a suitable structure in which both these conditions may be verified: indeed the 100-pc ring hosts the best candidate for Arches-like cluster precursor to date (Longmore et al. 2012), as well as the best example of a cloud-collision induced burst of star formation (Sgr B2). We propose to carry out an ALMA continuum and line survey of the 20 denser clumps (A_V > 50mag) along the portion of the 100-pc ring before their passage close to Sgr A*. The aim is to determine the initial conditions of the dense clumps that the 100-pc ring is assembling, before any triggering or compression event (like the passage close to Sgr A*) that can lead to the formation of Brick-like clouds.",MRing_b_03_TE,"Longmore, Steven; Schisano, Eugenio; Elia, Davide; Testi, Leonardo; Bally, John; Kruijssen, Diederik;",1.4989792348946127,0.053013366733909,2.2291738986968994,uid://A001/X2fb/X482,uid://A001/X2fb/X483,uid://A002/Xb08ef9/X82be,The initial conditions of Galactic Center Super-Cluster precursors: an ALMA survey of A_V >50 massive clumps along the 100-pc Ring.,S,TARGET,T,12.883949227559299,117187500.0,A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A008:DV08 A010:DV25 A011:DV09 A015:DV04 A023:DA51 A027:DV07 A029:DV10 A030:DA65 A031:DV17 A033:DV20 A034:DA46 A036:DV16 A037:DV19 A046:DA53 A048:DV15 A052:DA47 A061:DA62 A062:DA56 A063:DA44 A064:DV13 A065:DV06 A067:DA42 A068:DA45 A069:DV14 A070:DV21 A071:DA43 A072:DV05 A073:DA54 A074:DA48 A075:DV24 A076:DA52 A077:DA58 A078:DV12 A079:DA57 A080:DV23,T,2017-04-19T17:40:02.000,1.513936707048677,"[91.93..92.05GHz,141.11kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,244.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [92.44..92.56GHz,141.11kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,244.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [93.11..93.23GHz,141.11kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,244.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [93.94..94.06GHz,141.11kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,244.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [103.77..105.65GHz,976.56kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,62.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [105.94..106.06GHz,141.11kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,249.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [106.96..107.07GHz,141.11kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,249.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",93.17347839811845,395.48386747025114,"Molinari, Sergio",,,T,,High-mass star formation,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,N2H+ (1-0)

These are new features of the Galactic Center -- never seen before ALMA pointed at the Brick, and we don't know what they are. The features are almost unbelievable -- unresolved (<1.7'') in the narrow dimension and 30 to 50'' long with absorption seen over 20 km/s. We propose a quick and simple experiment to test two theories for the origin of these filaments: (1) ram-pressure confined shocks or (2) magnetic confinement of ions. We will attempt to measure the true width of the filaments by observing at 3 times higher angular resolution.

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage. ...(2)",2016,"The Galactic center uniquely provides the opportunities to resolve how the supermassive black hole accrete in inner than 5 pc scale.

An intermittent jet likely formed this channel and is consistent with earlier evidence of a sustained, Seyfert-level outburst fueled by black hole accretion onto Sgr A* several Myr ago. Therefore, to trace a now weak jet that perhaps penetrated, deflected, and percolated along multiple paths through the interstellar medium, relevant interactions are identified and quantified in archival X-ray images, Hubble Space Telescope Paschen α images and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array millimeter-wave spectra, and new SOAR telescope IR spectra. Hydrodynamical simulations are used to show how a nuclear jet can explain these structures and inflate the ROSAT/eROSITA X-ray and Fermi γ-ray bubbles that extend ± 75° from the Galactic plane. Thus, our Galactic outflow has features in common with energetic, jet-driven structures in the prototypical Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The Galactic center 50 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> molecular cloud (50MC) is the most remarkable molecular cloud in the Sagittarius A region. This cloud is a candidate for the massive star formation induced by cloud─cloud collision (CCC) with a collision velocity of ∼30 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> that is estimated from the velocity dispersion. We observed the whole of the 50MC with a high angular resolution (∼2.″0 × 1.″4) in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array cycle 1 in the H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 and C<SUP>34</SUP>S J = 2−1 emission lines. We identified 241 and 129 bound cores with a virial parameter of less than 2, which are thought to be gravitationally bound, in the H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUP>34</SUP>S maps using the clumpfind algorithm, respectively. In the CCC region, the bound H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUP>34</SUP>S cores are 119 and 82, whose masses are 68% and 76% of those in the whole 50MC, respectively. The distribution of the core number and column densities in the CCC are biased to larger densities than those in the non-CCC region. The distributions indicate that the CCC compresses the molecular gas and increases the number of the dense bound cores. Additionally, the massive bound cores with masses of &gt;3000 M <SUB>☉</SUB> exist only in the CCC region, although the slope of the core mass function (CMF) in the CCC region is not different from that in the non-CCC region. We conclude that the compression by the CCC efficiently formed massive bound cores even if the slope of the CMF is not changed so much by the CCC. ...(6)",2016,"In recent two decades, the young and highly luminous clusters in the Galactic center region, including Arches cluster, Quintuplet cluster, and Central cluster have been found by IR observations. The molecular clouds in the region are much denser, warmer, and more turbulent than disk molecular clouds. They are presumably the cradles of these bright star clusters. It is, however, an open question as to what mechanism is responsible for the formation of such star clusters in the cloud. The Galactic center 50 km s-1 molecular cloud is a most promising test bed to study of the star formation mechanism in the region.

An intermittent jet likely formed this channel and is consistent with earlier evidence of a sustained, Seyfert-level outburst fueled by black hole accretion onto Sgr A* several Myr ago. Therefore, to trace a now weak jet that perhaps penetrated, deflected, and percolated along multiple paths through the interstellar medium, relevant interactions are identified and quantified in archival X-ray images, Hubble Space Telescope Paschen α images and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array millimeter-wave spectra, and new SOAR telescope IR spectra. Hydrodynamical simulations are used to show how a nuclear jet can explain these structures and inflate the ROSAT/eROSITA X-ray and Fermi γ-ray bubbles that extend ± 75° from the Galactic plane. Thus, our Galactic outflow has features in common with energetic, jet-driven structures in the prototypical Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The Galactic center 50 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> molecular cloud (50MC) is the most remarkable molecular cloud in the Sagittarius A region. This cloud is a candidate for the massive star formation induced by cloud─cloud collision (CCC) with a collision velocity of ∼30 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> that is estimated from the velocity dispersion. We observed the whole of the 50MC with a high angular resolution (∼2.″0 × 1.″4) in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array cycle 1 in the H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 and C<SUP>34</SUP>S J = 2−1 emission lines. We identified 241 and 129 bound cores with a virial parameter of less than 2, which are thought to be gravitationally bound, in the H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUP>34</SUP>S maps using the clumpfind algorithm, respectively. In the CCC region, the bound H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUP>34</SUP>S cores are 119 and 82, whose masses are 68% and 76% of those in the whole 50MC, respectively. The distribution of the core number and column densities in the CCC are biased to larger densities than those in the non-CCC region. The distributions indicate that the CCC compresses the molecular gas and increases the number of the dense bound cores. Additionally, the massive bound cores with masses of &gt;3000 M <SUB>☉</SUB> exist only in the CCC region, although the slope of the core mass function (CMF) in the CCC region is not different from that in the non-CCC region. We conclude that the compression by the CCC efficiently formed massive bound cores even if the slope of the CMF is not changed so much by the CCC. ...(6)",2016,"In recent two decades, the young and highly luminous clusters in the Galactic center region, including Arches cluster, Quintuplet cluster, and Central cluster have been found by IR observations. The molecular clouds in the region are much denser, warmer, and more turbulent than disk molecular clouds. They are presumably the cradles of these bright star clusters. It is, however, an open question as to what mechanism is responsible for the formation of such star clusters in the cloud. The Galactic center 50 km s-1 molecular cloud is a most promising test bed to study of the star formation mechanism in the region. The core mass function of the clouds (CMF) is believed to be important for diagnosis of the star formation even in the Galactic center region.

Although the existence of vinyl cyanide (C2H3CN) on Titan was previously inferred using Cassini mass spectrometry, a definitive detection has been lacking until now. We report the first spectroscopic detection of vinyl cyanide in Titan's atmosphere, obtained using archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), collected from February to May 2014. We detect the three strongest rotational lines of C2H3CN in the frequency range of 230 to 232 GHz, each with >4σ confidence. Radiative transfer modeling suggests that most of the C2H3CN emission originates at altitudes of ≥200 km, in agreement with recent photochemical models. The vertical column densities implied by our best-fitting models lie in the range of 3.7 × 10^13 to 1.4 × 10^14 cm-2. The corresponding production rate of vinyl cyanide and its saturation mole fraction imply the availability of sufficient dissolved material to form ~10^7 cell membranes/cm3 in Titan's sea Ligeia Mare. We have exploited ALMA calibration observations to carry out a novel, wide, and deep submillimeter (submm) survey, almacal. These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of ˜25 μJy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on ≥5σ detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S 1.2 mm ≥ 0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 μm and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2×. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs—representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies—in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution. ...(1)",2015,"Sgr A* in the Galactic Center is by now the best constrained supermassive black hole candidate. Its radio spectrum peaks at submm-waves and its size as measured with VLBI experiments shrinks with increasing frequency, exhibiting a clear size-frequency relation. The millimeter-wave emission comes from less than four Schwarzschild radii (R_S) and will allow imaging of the event horizon with mmVLBI in the future. The predicted close encounter of the G2 gas cloud in mid-2013 will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study accretion processes on scales from a few thousand to a few R_S and explore the accretion-jet coupling that may take place in Sgr A*. First discovered through NIR astrometric imaging, G2 contains at least 3 M_Earth of dusty, ionized gas that is undergoing tidal disruption and will reach periastron of 3100 R_S. The millimeter flux density will rise as gas reaches a few R_S, which could be as short as the free fall time of a few months or as long as the viscous time of years to decades. Increased accretion rates could lead to an order of magnitude increase in the flux density, which will be indicative of a new accretion-jet state that can be imaged with VLBI. The G2 encounter represents a low mass, large impact parameter analog to stellar tidal disruption events, which have recently been show to produce coupled accretion and outflow events. We request 10 epochs of band 6 and 7 flux monitoring to search for evidence of increased accretion onto Sgr A*. This proposal is part of a multi-wavelength campaign to study the G2 encounter; we have approved multi-epoch Chandra X-ray time to observe Sgr A* in 2013. Finally, the integrated data set coupled with our Cycle 0 data will provide the best-ever multi-frequency map of the gas streamers (Sgr A West) in the Galactic Center and probe for new compact structures.",May_SgrA_352-216_12m_C32-any,"Fragile, Patrick; Baganoff, Frederick; Maitra, Dipankar; Schaaf, Reinhold; Utomo, Dyas; Moscibrodzka, Monika; Falcke, Heino; Brunthaler, Andreas; Menten, Karl; Brinkerink, Christiaan; Markoff, Sera; Marrone, Dan; Barkats, Denis; Dexter, Jason; Impellizzeri, Violette; Peck, Alison; Gammie, Charles; Rushton, Anthony; wright, melvyn;",1.9278102453540342,0.035518843260508255,0.6775668263435364,uid://A002/X7d1738/X44,uid://A002/X7d1738/X45,uid://A002/X829c4c/X5d6,The G2 Gas Cloud Encounter with Sagittarius A*: Accretion Structure on Scales of 3000 to 1 Schwarzschild Radii,S,TARGET WVR,T,3.4320137413660317,1875000000.0,A007:DV23 A011:DV22 A016:DA62 A019:DA63 A021:DA59 A031:DV11 A033:DV18 A034:DV20 A044:DV09 A045:DA50 A046:DA48 A058:DA46 A067:DV13 A069:DV16 A070:DA45 A071:DV10 A072:DV01 A074:DA47 A075:DA61 A076:DA57 A077:DV19 A078:DV04 A080:DA55 A082:DA51 A083:DV14 A085:DA64 A087:DV02 A089:DV15 A138:DV17 T701:PM03 T703:PM04,F,2015-07-28T18:27:13.000,0.3907965356724249,"[215.01..217.00GHz,31250.00kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,92.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [217.01..218.99GHz,31250.00kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,92.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [230.96..232.83GHz,976.56kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,96.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [232.78..234.76GHz,31250.00kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,93.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [338.61..340.59GHz,31250.00kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,100.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [340.61..342.59GHz,31250.00kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,100.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [350.73..352.72GHz,31250.00kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,101.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [352.66..354.54GHz,976.56kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,152.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",353.600055457742,825.7097402283028,"Bower, Geoffrey","ALMA detection and astrobiological potential of vinyl cyanide on Titan ALMACAL I: First Dual-band Number Counts from a Deep and Wide ALMA Submillimeter Survey, Free from Cosmic Variance Radio and Millimeter Monitoring of Sgr A*: Spectrum, Variability, and ","Bower, Geoffrey C.

Since the barred potential model have been invoked as a suitable mechanism for gas accretion, this work is the key to understand the feeding of gas towards the Galactic center.",1.3_comp_b_03_TE,"Kauffmann, Jens; Harada, Nanase; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Menten, Karl; Pillai, Thushara; Aladro, Rebeca;",7.147909823459064,0.1527843476272117,3.724186658859253,uid://A001/X2f7/X126,uid://A001/X2f7/X127,uid://A002/Xaebbcb/X5026,First resolved study of cloud-cloud collision at the edge of the Galactic center region,S,TARGET,T,27.89619120519627,1875000000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A003:DV23 A004:DA41 A005:DA54 A006:DA61 A007:DV02 A009:DV18 A010:DV25 A011:DV09 A013:DA48 A014:DV22 A017:DV12 A018:DA52 A020:DV03 A021:DA58 A023:DA51 A027:DV07 A030:DA65 A031:DV17 A033:DV20 A035:DA62 A036:DV16 A037:DV19 A038:DA50 A039:DA63 A042:DV01 A046:DA53 A048:DV15 A049:DV11 A050:DV24 A060:DA60 A062:DA56 A063:DA44 A064:DV13 A065:DV06 A068:DA45 A069:DV14 A070:DV21 A071:DA43 A072:DV05 T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,T,2017-05-04T13:29:06.000,2.2269262021793645,"[95.03..96.91GHz,488.28kHz,7.4mJy/beam@10km/s,307.4uJy/beam@native, XX] U [97.03..98.90GHz,488.28kHz,7.4mJy/beam@10km/s,307.5uJy/beam@native, XX] U [107.23..109.10GHz,488.28kHz,6.7mJy/beam@10km/s,292.7uJy/beam@native, XX] U [109.03..110.90GHz,488.28kHz,7.1mJy/beam@10km/s,316.1uJy/beam@native, XX]",109.96331434787425,1342.5413317645618,"Riquelme, Denise",,,T,,"Galactic centres/nuclei, Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC) properties",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,"13CO (1-0), C18O (1-0)"

At the center of our Milky Way, a similar question is whether the well-known 2-4 pc, ring-like molecular circumnuclear ""disk"" (CND) is dynamically captured from cooler large-scale gas clouds, or is a long-lived gas/dust ring supported and heated by strong radiation field from the central stellar cluster. In this project, we propose a focused ALMA experiment to detect DCN and DCO+ at where the exterior gas streams may be merging into the hot CND. These deurated species form efficiently when cool molecular gas condenses onto dust grain surfaces, and are destroyed rapidly in the hot gas phase. Observations of these molecules have been widely used as chemical clocks to diagnose the evolutionary status of accretion flows surrounding OB cluster-forming hot molecular cores. This project aim to address the gas accumulation in the innermost part of molecular accretion flows surrounding the nearest supermassive black hole, which will be used to infer the formation mechanism of the AGN obscuring dust tori.",Sgr_A_st_a_06_TE,"Hincelin, Ugo; Ho, Paul; Harada, Nanase; Mills, Elisabeth; wright, melvyn; Emsellem, Eric;",0.9861669866500645,0.0303944350562013,1.453674554824829,uid://A001/X2df/X9d,uid://A001/X2df/X9e,uid://A002/Xaeeace/X785,Testing a Chemical Model to Probe Supermassive Black Hole Accretion,S,TARGET,T,12.43547628219546,1875000000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A003:DV23 A004:DA41 A005:DA54 A006:DA61 A007:DV02 A009:DV18 A010:DV25 A013:DA48 A014:DV22 A015:DV04 A017:DV12 A018:DA52 A019:DA64 A020:DV03 A021:DA58 A023:DA51 A025:DA57 A027:DV07 A029:DV10 A030:DA65 A031:DV17 A034:DA46 A035:DA62 A036:DV16 A037:DV19 A038:DA50 A039:DA63 A042:DV01 A046:DA53 A047:DA55 A048:DV15 A049:DV11 A050:DV24 A052:DA47 A060:DA60 A062:DA56 A063:DA44 A064:DV13 A065:DV06 A067:DA42 A068:DA45 A069:DV14 A070:DV21 A071:DA43 A072:DV05 T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,T,2017-05-06T19:49:14.000,0.9456800371447421,"[214.76..216.64GHz,1128.91kHz,989uJy/beam@10km/s,61.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [216.31..218.19GHz,1128.91kHz,986.2uJy/beam@10km/s,61.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [229.96..231.83GHz,1128.91kHz,940.5uJy/beam@10km/s,60.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.76..233.63GHz,1128.91kHz,937.7uJy/beam@10km/s,60.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.24871644000763,1460.1683689465767,"Liu, Hauyu Baobab",,,T,,"Galaxy chemistry, Galactic centres/nuclei",Galaxy evolution,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (5-4)

Previous works have shown that the molecular gas have two distinct velocity components, one associated with the X1-orbits and the other associated with the X2-orbits (in a barred potential model). These two components have different physical and chemical characteristics between each other: the gas following the X2 orbits has ""normal"" Galactic center properties (high densities and temperatures, expected chemical enrichment according to the chemical evolution model of the Galaxy), and the gas in the X1 orbits has a lower density, higher temperatures and a lower chemical enrichment (high 12C/13C isotopic ratio).

Since the barred potential model have been invoked as a suitable mechanism for gas accretion, this work is the key to understand the feeding of gas towards the Galactic center.",1.3_comp_a_03_TE,"Kauffmann, Jens; Harada, Nanase; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Menten, Karl; Pillai, Thushara; Aladro, Rebeca;",5.868724871742627,0.11855846840156632,2.8980183601379395,uid://A001/X2f7/X122,uid://A001/X2f7/X123,uid://A002/Xaeaf96/X2150,First resolved study of cloud-cloud collision at the edge of the Galactic center region,S,TARGET,T,32.145499247302624,1875000000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A003:DV23 A004:DA41 A005:DA54 A006:DA61 A007:DV02 A009:DV18 A010:DV25 A011:DV09 A013:DA48 A014:DV22 A015:DV04 A017:DV12 A020:DV03 A021:DA58 A023:DA51 A025:DA57 A027:DV07 A030:DA65 A031:DV17 A033:DV20 A035:DA62 A036:DV16 A037:DV19 A038:DA50 A039:DA63 A042:DV01 A047:DA55 A048:DV15 A049:DV11 A050:DV24 A060:DA60 A063:DA44 A064:DV13 A065:DV06 A067:DA42 A068:DA45 A070:DV21 A072:DV05 T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,T,2017-05-13T12:43:03.000,2.461995481476017,"[86.64..88.51GHz,488.28kHz,5.9mJy/beam@10km/s,234.1uJy/beam@native, XX] U [88.53..90.41GHz,488.28kHz,5.9mJy/beam@10km/s,234.1uJy/beam@native, XX] U [98.83..100.70GHz,488.28kHz,5.6mJy/beam@10km/s,234.6uJy/beam@native, XX] U [100.53..102.40GHz,488.28kHz,5.8mJy/beam@10km/s,246.3uJy/beam@native, XX]",89.46973068991383,1456.025990564833,"Riquelme, Denise",,,T,,"Galactic centres/nuclei, Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC) properties",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,"HCO+ (1-0), HCN (1-0)"

A massive dense clump precursor must be assembled and kept stable against fragmentation long enough to form massive stars; on the other hand a strong triggering mechanism must be available to justify the formation of a cluster with a top-heavy IMF.

Thus far, only five SiO masers have been identified towards such regions in the Galaxy. Each of these is in some way unique, and so far no clear connection between them has been identified. In this proposal, we target a high-mass-star forming region (HMSFR) in the Galactic centre cloud G0.38+0.04. This is a high-luminosity (6.5x10^4 Lsun), young (pre-UCHII) HMSFR and is the richest site of rare maser emission yet known in the Galaxy. It is therefore an ideal source for advancing our understanding of SiO maser emission and its relation to HMSFRs. Our proposed ALMA observations have the unique capability of simultaneously detecting the dust, thermal SiO, and vibrationally excited SiO in the same observation, whilst achieving extremely high spatial (0.078"") and spectral (~ 0.4 km/s) resolution.

The high brightness temperature of SgrA* would compensate the low optical depth of faint features. This is a resubmission of our Cycle 1 proposal as it still may not get scheduled within Cycle 2.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars. These data will provide a unique test for star formation theories in such extreme regimes and allow us to place constraints on the dominant physical mechanisms governing the formation of the most massive stars.",e_sma1_a_06_TM1,"Alves, Joao; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Johnston, Katharine; Lu, Xing; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Ginsburg, Adam; Longmore, Steven; Zhang, Qizhou; Barnes, Ashley; Kauffmann, Jens; Gomez, Laura; Keto, Eric; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ho, Luis; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate; Pillai, Thushara;",1.7581589327392,0.06187034767071748,0.9465754628181458,uid://A001/X87d/X144,uid://A001/X87d/X145,uid://A002/Xb93c37/X1120,Uncovering the Early Formation of Extremely Massive Stars,S,CHECK WVR,F,1.8000257285257049,937500000.0,A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A007:DV12 A009:DV18 A034:DA46 A048:DV23 A064:DV13 A065:DV01 A074:DV09 A075:DV24 A081:DA53 A084:DV07 A085:DA47 A086:DV11 A087:DV10 A088:DA57 A091:DA63 A092:DV17 A093:DV02 A094:DA45 A095:DV25 A096:DA65 A097:DV03 A098:DV21 A099:DV06 A100:DA56 A101:DA60 A102:DV16 A103:DA62 A104:DV14 A105:DA42 A106:DV08 A108:DA54 A109:DA55 A111:DV05 A112:DA50 A113:DV15 A114:DA52 A115:DA44 A116:DA48 A129:DA61 A130:DA64 A135:DV19 A136:DV04,F,2018-01-07T14:48:46.000,0.16075430260984175,"[216.97..217.20GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,311uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.08..218.32GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,311.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.34..218.57GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,311.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.62..218.85GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,311.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [220.22..221.16GHz,564.45kHz,1.8mJy/beam@10km/s,155.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.54..233.41GHz,1938.48kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,105.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [234.04..235.91GHz,1938.48kHz,1.6mJy/beam@10km/s,105.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",220.68647667002816,765.2032703201826,"Walker, Daniel",Star formation in 'the Brick': ALMA reveals an active protocluster in the Galactic centre cloud G0.253+0.016 The initial conditions for young massive cluster formation in the Galactic Centre: convergence of large-scale gas flows,"Walker, Daniel L.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr.

These data will provide a unique test for star formation theories in such extreme regimes and allow us to place constraints on the dominant physical mechanisms governing the formation of the most massive stars.",e_sma1_a_06_TM1,"Alves, Joao; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Johnston, Katharine; Lu, Xing; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Ginsburg, Adam; Longmore, Steven; Zhang, Qizhou; Barnes, Ashley; Kauffmann, Jens; Gomez, Laura; Keto, Eric; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ho, Luis; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate; Pillai, Thushara;",0.45691532030525506,0.015974851533659976,0.9465754628181458,uid://A001/X87d/X144,uid://A001/X87d/X145,uid://A002/Xb93c37/X1120,Uncovering the Early Formation of Extremely Massive Stars,S,TARGET,T,1.84771573054409,234375000.0,A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A007:DV12 A009:DV18 A034:DA46 A048:DV23 A064:DV13 A065:DV01 A074:DV09 A075:DV24 A081:DA53 A084:DV07 A085:DA47 A086:DV11 A087:DV10 A088:DA57 A091:DA63 A092:DV17 A093:DV02 A094:DA45 A095:DV25 A096:DA65 A097:DV03 A098:DV21 A099:DV06 A100:DA56 A101:DA60 A102:DV16 A103:DA62 A104:DV14 A105:DA42 A106:DV08 A108:DA54 A109:DA55 A111:DV05 A112:DA50 A113:DV15 A114:DA52 A115:DA44 A116:DA48 A129:DA61 A130:DA64 A135:DV19 A136:DV04,F,2018-01-07T14:48:46.000,0.16177966201115507,"[216.97..217.20GHz,564.45kHz,456.9uJy/beam@10km/s,80.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.08..218.32GHz,564.45kHz,456uJy/beam@10km/s,80.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.34..218.57GHz,564.45kHz,455.8uJy/beam@10km/s,80.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.62..218.85GHz,564.45kHz,455.5uJy/beam@10km/s,80.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [220.22..221.15GHz,564.45kHz,454uJy/beam@10km/s,40.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.54..233.41GHz,1938.48kHz,424.4uJy/beam@10km/s,27.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [234.04..235.91GHz,1938.48kHz,422.7uJy/beam@10km/s,27.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.08224678613635,765.2032703201826,"Walker, Daniel",Star formation in 'the Brick': ALMA reveals an active protocluster in the Galactic centre cloud G0.253+0.016 The initial conditions for young massive cluster formation in the Galactic Centre: convergence of large-scale gas flows,"Walker, Daniel L.

Methods: We report continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from ALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings to the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position angles and polarization percentages. Results: We successfully detect polarized continuum emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I intensity at ~700 GHz than that at ~500 GHz, which suggests that emission at ≳500 GHz is from the optically thin part of a synchrotron emission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position angle at our highest observing frequency of ~700 GHz, may vary with time. However, as yet we do not detect variation in the polarization percentage at &#62;500 GHz. The polarization percentage at ~700 GHz is likely lower than that at ~500 GHz. By comparing the ~500 GHz and ~700 GHz observations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* varies with time. This paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed calibration quasars. Conclusions: Future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization observations are required to clarify the time and frequency variation of the polarization position angle and polarization percentage.",2016,"Previous observations of hydrogen recombination lines toward the Galactic center detected ionized mini spiral arms, which appear to be material that is gravitationally accreted toward the Galactic supermassive black hole SgrA*. The new capabilities offered by Cycle 2 ALMA in band 9 allow us to probe the very hot neutral counterpart in the very central region. By observing the spatial distribution, the velocity, and the linewidth of this gas, we will determine how closely the hot neutral material can approach SgrA*, without being ionized, and to constrain the excitation conditions of this material within a ~0.1 pc radius. The optimal tracer of this material is multiple, highly-excited molecular transitions, which will better differentiate zone of different excitations, and provide more information on the kinematics of the accretion flow than observations of the hydrogen recombination line.",SgrA_sta_c_09_7M,"Minh, Young; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Hsieh, Pei-Ying; Su, Yu-Nung;",149.37638820510978,7.066623355935887,0.6600000262260437,uid://A001/X122/X416,uid://A001/X122/X419,uid://A002/X87b480/X780,Defining the Neutral Material which Survives to within 0.1 parsec of the Galactic Supermassive Black Hole,S,TARGET,T,10.102291884991214,1992187500.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2021-04-21T00:00:00.000,1.6946444591268783,"[687.74..689.73GHz,3904.30kHz,138.3mJy/beam@10km/s,14.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [687.74..689.73GHz,3904.30kHz,187.3mJy/beam@10km/s,20.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [689.57..691.56GHz,3904.30kHz,133.4mJy/beam@10km/s,14.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [691.38..693.37GHz,3904.30kHz,141.9mJy/beam@10km/s,15.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [693.18..695.17GHz,3904.30kHz,149.4mJy/beam@10km/s,16.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",694.1731986970177,1683.7764718308233,"Ho, Paul",Linearly polarized millimeter and submillimeter continuum emission of Sgr A* constrained by ALMA,"Liu, Hauyu Baobab",T,2016A&A...593A.107L,Galactic centres/nuclei,Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (16-15)

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.

Our results from the GRS 1758-258 region in particular, are consistent with recent work, which postulated the presence of a jet-blown cocoon structure in deep radio continuum maps of the region. Using these newly discovered molecular structures as calorimeters, we estimate the time averaged jet power from these systems, finding $(1.1{\!-\!}5.7)\times 10^{36}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.12-0.31 Myr for GRS 1758-258 and $(0.7{\!-\!}3.5)\times 10^{37}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.10-0.26 Myr for 1E 1740.7-2942.

As these lines provide for excellent diagnostics of shock energetics and ISM excitation, we can definitively test whether these candidate zones are powered by a BHXB jet, and, if the association is confirmed, measure the injected jet power through calorimetry.",GRS_1758_a_03_7M,"Miller-Jones, James; Rosolowsky, Erik; Sivakoff, Gregory;",67.0263273675899,2.4130938699580557,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X1284/X195e,uid://A001/X1284/X195f,uid://A002/Xc8592e/Xfc7c,Mapping Jet-ISM Interactions in X-ray Binaries,S,TARGET,T,63.49749460141775,125000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2019-09-19T00:00:00.000,9.804731795148784,"[107.01..108.99GHz,31250.00kHz,61.2mJy/beam@10km/s,2.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [109.72..109.84GHz,282.23kHz,65.3mJy/beam@10km/s,11.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [109.84..109.97GHz,282.23kHz,66.1mJy/beam@10km/s,11.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [110.14..110.26GHz,282.23kHz,67mJy/beam@10km/s,11.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",110.20148156645686,768.1663332502987,"Tetarenko, Alexandra",ALMACAL - VI.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc).

P.; Tang, Ya-Wen; Beck, Sara","Utilizing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we present CS line maps in five rotational lines (J<SUB>u</SUB> = 7, 5, 4, 3, 2) toward the circumnuclear disk (CND) and streamers of the Galactic center. Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales.

We will perform the first detailed observational test of cloud collapse by tidal compression where the influence of the tidal field is the strongest.",Stone_Cl_a_06_TP,"Longmore, Steven; Zhang, Qizhou; Walker, Daniel; Kauffmann, Jens; Klessen, Ralf; Mills, Elisabeth; Keto, Eric; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Tolls, Volker; Ho, Luis; Lu, Xing; Rathborne, Jill; Glover, Simon; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Pillai, Thushara; Ginsburg, Adam;",9.24102519330573,0.31108625045613514,1.682520866394043,uid://A001/X892/X7,uid://A001/X892/Xe,uid://A002/Xb95160/X8647,Testing a New Mode for Cloud Collapse in Galaxy Centers,S,TARGET,T,412.4577317759457,125000000.0,T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04 T704:PM01,F,2018-04-11T00:31:32.000,23.269147754184964,"[217.01..217.13GHz,244.14kHz,9.2mJy/beam@10km/s,2.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.12..218.25GHz,244.14kHz,9.3mJy/beam@10km/s,2.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.38..218.50GHz,244.14kHz,8.9mJy/beam@10km/s,2.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.66..218.79GHz,244.14kHz,8.7mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.87..220.87GHz,1128.91kHz,9.6mJy/beam@10km/s,583.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.00..233.00GHz,1128.91kHz,8.6mJy/beam@10km/s,533.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [232.76..234.76GHz,1128.91kHz,9.2mJy/beam@10km/s,574.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.06830848151316,334.49036400383636,"Battersby, Cara",,,T,,"High-mass star formation, Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (5-4)

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions.

We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected.

In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas.

Our results from the GRS 1758-258 region in particular, are consistent with recent work, which postulated the presence of a jet-blown cocoon structure in deep radio continuum maps of the region. Using these newly discovered molecular structures as calorimeters, we estimate the time averaged jet power from these systems, finding $(1.1{\!-\!}5.7)\times 10^{36}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.12-0.31 Myr for GRS 1758-258 and $(0.7{\!-\!}3.5)\times 10^{37}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.10-0.26 Myr for 1E 1740.7-2942.

Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), the stellar-mass analogues of active galactic nuclei (AGN), are ideal targets for studying the interactions between the jet and the ambient ISM in detail, due to their close proximity and the rapid timescale evolution of BHXB jets. Identifying and probing the ISM properties in interaction zones provides insight into highly sought-after jet properties, such as the total jet power, composition, duty cycles, and the efficiency of jet feedback. We propose targeting the candidate interaction sites around the BHXBs, GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942, with Band 3 ALMA ACA observations. We will map the CO, SiO, CS, HCO+, HCN, and HNCO line emission over 4.5 square arcmin for each target (our targets are within 5 deg, and can thus be observed in a single execution).

R.","We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array observations of the candidate jet-ISM interaction zones near the black hole X-ray binaries GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942. Using these data, we map the molecular line emission in the regions, detecting emission from the HCN [J = 1-0], HCO<SUP>+</SUP> [J = 1-0], SiO [J = 2-1], CS [J = 2-1], <SUP>13</SUP>CO [J = 1-0], C<SUP>18</SUP>O [J = 1-0], HNCO [J = 4<SUB>0,4</SUB>-3<SUB>0,3</SUB>], HNCO [J = 5<SUB>0,5</SUB>-4<SUB>0,4</SUB>], and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH [J = 2<SUB>1,1</SUB>-1<SUB>1,0</SUB>] molecular transitions. Through examining the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of this emission, we identify molecular structures that may trace jet-driven cavities in the gas surrounding these systems. Our results from the GRS 1758-258 region in particular, are consistent with recent work, which postulated the presence of a jet-blown cocoon structure in deep radio continuum maps of the region. Using these newly discovered molecular structures as calorimeters, we estimate the time averaged jet power from these systems, finding $(1.1{\!-\!}5.7)\times 10^{36}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.12-0.31 Myr for GRS 1758-258 and $(0.7{\!-\!}3.5)\times 10^{37}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.10-0.26 Myr for 1E 1740.7-2942. Additionally, the spectral line characteristics of the detected emission place these molecular structures in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy, thereby constraining the distances to the black hole X-ray binaries to be 8.0 ± 1.0 kpc.

Aminoacetonitrile, a molecule detected in the interstellar medium only toward the star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), is considered an important prebiotic species; in particular, it is a possible precursor of the simplest amino acid glycine. To date, observations have been limited to ground state emission lines, whereas transitions from within vibrationally excited states remained undetected. <BR /> Aims: We wanted to accurately determine the energies of the low-lying vibrational states of aminoacetonitrile, which are expected to be populated in Sgr B2(N1), the main hot core of Sgr B2(N). This step is fundamental in order to properly evaluate the vibration-rotation partition function of aminoacetonitrile as well as the line strengths of the rotational transitions of its vibrationally excited states. This is necessary to derive accurate column densities and secure the identification of these transitions in astronomical spectra. <BR /> Methods: The far-infrared ro-vibrational spectrum of aminoacetonitrile has been recorded in absorption against a synchrotron source of continuum emission. Three bands, corresponding to the lowest vibrational modes of aminoacetonitrile, were observed in the frequency region below 500 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The combined analysis of ro-vibrational and pure rotational data allowed us to prepare new spectral line catalogs for all the states under investigation. We used the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA performed with ALMA to search for vibrationally excited aminoacetonitrile toward Sgr B2(N1). The astronomical spectra were analyzed under the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation. <BR /> Results: Almost 11 000 lines have been assigned during the analysis of the laboratory spectrum of aminoacetonitrile, thanks to which the vibrational energies of the v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1, v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1, and v<SUB>17</SUB> = 1 states have been determined. The whole dataset, which includes high J and K<SUB>a</SUB> transitions, is well reproduced within the experimental accuracy. Reliable spectral predictions of pure rotational lines can now be produced up to the THz region. On the basis of these spectroscopic predictions, we report the interstellar detection of aminoacetonitrile in its v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 vibrational states toward Sgr B2(N1) in addition to emission from its vibrational ground state. The intensities of the identified v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 lines are consistent with the detected v = 0 lines under LTE at a temperature of 200 K for an aminoacetonitrile column density of 1.1 × 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: This work shows the strong interplay between laboratory spectroscopy exploiting (sub)millimeter and synchrotron-based far-infrared techniques, and observational spectral surveys to detect complex organic molecules in space and quantify their abundances. <P />The list of assigned transitions is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160</A> ...(6)",2019,"ALMA has had a transformational effect on the search for complex organic molecules (COMs) in star-forming regions, pushing the limits of observable chemical complexity. Our recent detection of a branched alkyl molecule in the interstellar medium (ISM) with ALMA has opened a new domain in the structures available to the chemistry of star-forming regions, beyond simple chains. Our astrochemical model was recently expanded to include branched isomers, and indicates that branched molecules may be dominant in star-forming regions where the chemistry is of sufficient complexity. We propose to perform a direct observational test of this hypothesis, in order to determine both the degree and the manner in which chemical complexity evolves during star formation.

P.; Tang, Ya-Wen; Beck, Sara","Utilizing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we present CS line maps in five rotational lines (J<SUB>u</SUB> = 7, 5, 4, 3, 2) toward the circumnuclear disk (CND) and streamers of the Galactic center. Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*. (3) Fit the inflow kinematics to constrain theoretical models for their dynamics and fates.",cnd_cs21_a_03_7M,"Wang, Hsiang-Hsu; Tang, Ya-Wen; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick; Harada, Nanase; Kim, Woong-Tae;",33.738103846235525,1.3144956966457337,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X1284/X16bb,uid://A001/X1284/X16c0,uid://A002/Xc59134/X3fe1,Replenishing Molecular Gas Near the Supermassive Black Hole SgrA*,S,TARGET,T,74.18907834820733,500000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2019-07-25T00:00:00.000,10.38997001989381,"[85.95..86.45GHz,282.23kHz,33mJy/beam@10km/s,2.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.35..88.85GHz,282.23kHz,33.7mJy/beam@10km/s,2.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.75..98.25GHz,282.23kHz,32.4mJy/beam@10km/s,2.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.75..100.25GHz,282.23kHz,34.8mJy/beam@10km/s,2.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",88.59969806718884,848.236894945641,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA.

Our previous GBT-100m and SMA observations of molecular lines have revealed that the well-known 2-4 pc Galactic circumnuclear disk (CND) may consist of a convergence of several >2 pc scale molecular gas streams. The ionized mini-spiral arms in the inner ~1 pc radius further indicate that a portion of these molecular gas streams may penetrate inside the CND. However, the previous 22"" resolution OI line observations suggested that the ionized mini-spiral arms may be merely the ionized rim of the ~10 times more massive atomic gas streams. With this proposal, we seek to take advantage of the new CI observation capability of ALMA Band 8, to resolve these atomic gas streams at subarcsecond resolution.

The maser is seen in both lower-resolution (3″ or ∼0.1 pc) data from 2012 and higher-resolution (0.″1 or ∼1000 au) data from 2018. In the higher-resolution data NH<SUB>3</SUB> (2,2) maser emission is detected toward five independent spots. The maser spots are not spatially or kinematically coincident with any other masers in this region, or with the peaks of the radio continuum emission from the numerous ultracompact and hypercompact H II regions in this area. While the (2,2) maser spots are spatially unresolved in our highest-resolution observations, they have unusually broad line widths of several kilometers per second, which suggests that each of these spots consists of multiple masers tracing unresolved velocity structure.

The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF).

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study.

We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF). This is largely due to the lack of clear--cut examples of dense clumps that are bound to form stars but have not done so yet (high--mass starless clumps: HMSCs). While scattered, small sky patch searches have been made, no systematic galaxy wide survey that can place such searches on a statistical firm footing has ever been conducted. We have now performed a systematic search for HMSCs from the ATLASGAL 870mu survey that covers the entire inner Galactic plane which are dense and devoid of infrared sources up to 70mum. Embedded star formation will manifest via outflowing, shocked, and warm gas component with little or no evidence of cold gas towards dense cores. By weeding out such masqueraders, and revealing the extent of fragmentation in all HMSCs, a feat only achievable with a survey machine like ALMA in an ambitious but highly economical <10 hrs main array time, we will for the first time reveal the truly massive starless cores.

A massive dense clump precursor must be assembled and kept stable against fragmentation long enough to form massive stars, and a mechanism must be provided to trigger the formation of a top-heavy IMF cluster. The 100-pc ring of dense and cold clouds orbiting around the Galactic Center (Molinari et al. 2011) may offer both conditions: it hosts the best candidate for Arches-like precursor (Longmore et al. 2012), as well as the best example of a cloud-collision induced burst of star formation (Sgr B2). To test our hypothesis that the ring is the structure that channels material into high-mass prestellar clumps, we obtained Cycle 3 ALMA 12m-array priority ""A"" time to carry out a continuum and line survey of the denser clumps (Av > 50 mag) along the 100-pc ring.

The CND consists of several molecular cores with sizes of 0.1 pc. The CND, being the final place of the molecular reservoir in the Galactic center (GC), is critical to our understanding of the feeding of SgrA*. Additionally, knowing the life time of the CND is paramount. Two key factors control this life time: (1) the tidal threshold by SgrA* exerted on the gas, and (2) replenishment from exterior gas inflows. Earlier low-resolution (beam > 24) data suggest that the CND is transient because of its low density. High-resolution (0.1 pc) data are awaited to confirm this. We found a molecular streamer, originating from the ambient clouds with progressively higher velocities as it approaches the CND, in our CS(2-1) map (beam=40"" (1.5 pc)). This shows evidence of gas replenishment onto the CND. This rises the question whether the streamer consists of dense cores that are able to resist tidal disruption. We propose to obtain a 0.1 parsec resolution map to resolve the dense cores feeding the GC along the streamer and its parent cloud with various density tracers.",gc_b_1_03_TM1,"Hwang, Chorng-Yuan; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick;",6.273657629607299,0.20483916450802073,1.2787402868270874,uid://A001/X899/Xc4,uid://A001/X899/Xc5,uid://A002/Xbb54fa/X260,Is the Molecular Inflow in the Galactic Center Transient?,S,TARGET,T,13.833575600272225,937500000.0,A001:DA59 A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A006:DV15 A009:DV18 A010:DV23 A015:DA61 A027:DA56 A029:DA60 A034:DA46 A045:DV16 A047:DA62 A054:DV19 A060:DV06 A061:DA44 A062:DV14 A064:DV13 A065:DV01 A067:DV02 A068:DV08 A069:DA55 A070:DV12 A071:DA48 A073:DA42 A074:DV09 A075:DV24 A076:DA54 A077:DA52 A078:DV05 A079:DA64 A080:DA50 A081:DA53 A084:DV07 A085:DA47 A086:DV11 A087:DV10 A089:DA58 A090:DV04 A091:DA63 A092:DV17,T,2018-03-15T08:07:39.000,1.2469311396441238,"[86.38..87.32GHz,488.28kHz,6.3mJy/beam@10km/s,348.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.51..98.45GHz,488.28kHz,5.9mJy/beam@10km/s,349.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.61..100.55GHz,488.28kHz,6.2mJy/beam@10km/s,367uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",86.84696476478679,1469.5849482626559,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",,,T,,Galactic centres/nuclei,Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (2-1)

Depending upon the mass of this gas reservoir, the fate of the CND (whether it will it form stars, or eventually accrete on the black hole) will have a substantial impact on the evolution of the central parsec of our Galaxy. Its fate depends upon its density: gas clumps with densities > 10^7 cm^-3 are stable, and can collapse and form stars, whereas unstable clumps should quickly be sheared apart and eventually accrete onto the black hole. We propose to use the resolution and sensitivity of Cycle 2 ALMA to conduct a robust probe of gas density on the scales of individual clumps (1"", or 0.04 pc) via simultaneous excitation analyses of multiple tracers and the inclusion of radiative excitation. Ultimately, this study will yield the authoritative values for the CND mass and density, quantities which vary in recent literature by 3-4 orders of magnitude, and will indicate the amount of gas present in the central parsecs, and whether it will feed the central black hole or contribute to a nuclear starburst.",Circumnu_a_06_TP,"Harada, Nanase; Zhao, Jun-Hui; Morris, Mark; Wardle, Mark; Riquelme, Denise; Moser, Lydia; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Ho, Paul; Martin, Sergio; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Guesten, Rolf; Ginsburg, Adam;",16.20488157746647,0.5658355632061385,1.351098895072937,uid://A001/X121/X2d9,uid://A001/X121/X2de,uid://A002/Xa16f89/X10bb,The Density (and Destiny) of the Circumnuclear Disk,S,TARGET WVR,T,356.8358496255691,1992187500.0,T701:PM03 T702:PM02 T703:PM04,F,2016-10-16T17:41:45.000,20.131225191083388,"[251.48..253.47GHz,1128.91kHz,18.2mJy/beam@10km/s,1.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [253.72..255.71GHz,1128.91kHz,18.2mJy/beam@10km/s,1.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [265.73..267.72GHz,1128.91kHz,16.2mJy/beam@10km/s,1.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [268.71..270.70GHz,1128.91kHz,16.1mJy/beam@10km/s,1.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",266.72100487613415,1250.1250557012945,"Mills, Elisabeth",,,T,,"Starbursts, star formation, Galactic centres/nuclei",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,"HCO+ (3-2), HCN (3-2)"

Aminoacetonitrile, a molecule detected in the interstellar medium only toward the star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), is considered an important prebiotic species; in particular, it is a possible precursor of the simplest amino acid glycine. To date, observations have been limited to ground state emission lines, whereas transitions from within vibrationally excited states remained undetected. <BR /> Aims: We wanted to accurately determine the energies of the low-lying vibrational states of aminoacetonitrile, which are expected to be populated in Sgr B2(N1), the main hot core of Sgr B2(N). This step is fundamental in order to properly evaluate the vibration-rotation partition function of aminoacetonitrile as well as the line strengths of the rotational transitions of its vibrationally excited states. This is necessary to derive accurate column densities and secure the identification of these transitions in astronomical spectra. <BR /> Methods: The far-infrared ro-vibrational spectrum of aminoacetonitrile has been recorded in absorption against a synchrotron source of continuum emission. Three bands, corresponding to the lowest vibrational modes of aminoacetonitrile, were observed in the frequency region below 500 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The combined analysis of ro-vibrational and pure rotational data allowed us to prepare new spectral line catalogs for all the states under investigation. We used the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA performed with ALMA to search for vibrationally excited aminoacetonitrile toward Sgr B2(N1). The astronomical spectra were analyzed under the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation. <BR /> Results: Almost 11 000 lines have been assigned during the analysis of the laboratory spectrum of aminoacetonitrile, thanks to which the vibrational energies of the v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1, v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1, and v<SUB>17</SUB> = 1 states have been determined. The whole dataset, which includes high J and K<SUB>a</SUB> transitions, is well reproduced within the experimental accuracy. Reliable spectral predictions of pure rotational lines can now be produced up to the THz region. On the basis of these spectroscopic predictions, we report the interstellar detection of aminoacetonitrile in its v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 vibrational states toward Sgr B2(N1) in addition to emission from its vibrational ground state. The intensities of the identified v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 lines are consistent with the detected v = 0 lines under LTE at a temperature of 200 K for an aminoacetonitrile column density of 1.1 × 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: This work shows the strong interplay between laboratory spectroscopy exploiting (sub)millimeter and synchrotron-based far-infrared techniques, and observational spectral surveys to detect complex organic molecules in space and quantify their abundances. <P />The list of assigned transitions is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160</A> ...(6)",2019,"ALMA has had a transformational effect on the search for complex organic molecules (COMs) in star-forming regions, pushing the limits of observable chemical complexity. Our recent detection of a branched alkyl molecule in the interstellar medium (ISM) with ALMA has opened a new domain in the structures available to the chemistry of star-forming regions, beyond simple chains. Our astrochemical model was recently expanded to include branched isomers, and indicates that branched molecules may be dominant in star-forming regions where the chemistry is of sufficient complexity. We propose to perform a direct observational test of this hypothesis, in order to determine both the degree and the manner in which chemical complexity evolves during star formation. We propose to search for n-butyl cyanide and its three branched isomers toward Sgr B2(N), the most fruitful target for new detections of COMs in the ISM. The discovery of biologically-relevant molecules in the ISM is of high scientific impact.

We focus on several potential shock tracers that are usually abundant in protostellar outflows, including SiO, SO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, HC<SUB>3</SUB>N, and HNCO. We identify 43 protostellar outflows, including 37 highly likely ones and 6 candidates. The outflows are found toward both known high-mass star-forming cores and less massive, seemingly quiescent cores, while 791 out of the 834 cores identified based on the continuum do not have detected outflows. The outflow masses range from less than 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to a few tens of M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with typical uncertainties of a factor of 70. We do not find evidence of disagreement between relative molecular abundances in these outflows and in nearby analogs such as the well-studied L1157 and NGC 7538S outflows. The results suggest that (i) protostellar accretion disks driving outflows ubiquitously exist in the CMZ environment, (ii) the large fraction of candidate starless cores is expected if these clouds are at very early evolutionary phases, with a caveat on the potential incompleteness of the outflows, (iii) high-mass and low-mass star formation is ongoing simultaneously in these clouds, and (iv) current data do not show evidence of a difference between the shock chemistry in the outflows that determines the molecular abundances in the CMZ environment and in nearby clouds. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 continuum observations of 2000 au resolution toward four massive molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy. To study gas fragmentation, we use the dendrogram method to identify cores as traced by the dust continuum emission. The four clouds exhibit different fragmentation states at the observed resolution despite having similar masses at the cloud scale (∼1-5 pc). Assuming a constant dust temperature of 20 K, we construct core mass functions of the clouds and find a slightly top-heavy shape as compared to the canonical initial mass function, but we note several significant uncertainties that may affect this result. The characteristic spatial separation between the cores as identified by the minimum spanning tree method, ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> au, and the characteristic core mass, 1-7 ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;, are consistent with predictions of thermal Jeans fragmentation. The three clouds showing fragmentation may be forming OB associations (stellar mass ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;). None of the four clouds under investigation seem to be currently able to form massive star clusters like the Arches and the Quintuplet (≳10<SUP>4</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;), but they may form such clusters by further gas accretion onto the cores.",2020,"The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), is a star-forming environment with extreme physical properties. Despite its large reservoir of dense gas, the CMZ appears to have a much lower current star formation rate than what the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation predicts. Theories have suggested an episodic star formation cycle which is at its near-minimum now. Our VLA and SMA observations towards a sample of four CMZ clouds have detected a population of protostellar candidates, traced by gravitationally bound dense cores and H2O masers. They may suggest an increase of current star formation than in the last few million years, consistent with the episodic star formation mode in the CMZ. However the existing data cannot confirm definitely the protostellar nature of these candidates. We propose to use ALMA, with its unprecedented capability of high sensitivity and high dynamic range, to observe these protostellar candidates. The project, aiming at detecting compact CH3CN emission from natal hot molecular cores, will confirm or reject the presence of embedded protostars.

We do not find evidence of disagreement between relative molecular abundances in these outflows and in nearby analogs such as the well-studied L1157 and NGC 7538S outflows. The results suggest that (i) protostellar accretion disks driving outflows ubiquitously exist in the CMZ environment, (ii) the large fraction of candidate starless cores is expected if these clouds are at very early evolutionary phases, with a caveat on the potential incompleteness of the outflows, (iii) high-mass and low-mass star formation is ongoing simultaneously in these clouds, and (iv) current data do not show evidence of a difference between the shock chemistry in the outflows that determines the molecular abundances in the CMZ environment and in nearby clouds. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 continuum observations of 2000 au resolution toward four massive molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy. To study gas fragmentation, we use the dendrogram method to identify cores as traced by the dust continuum emission. The four clouds exhibit different fragmentation states at the observed resolution despite having similar masses at the cloud scale (∼1-5 pc). Assuming a constant dust temperature of 20 K, we construct core mass functions of the clouds and find a slightly top-heavy shape as compared to the canonical initial mass function, but we note several significant uncertainties that may affect this result. The characteristic spatial separation between the cores as identified by the minimum spanning tree method, ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> au, and the characteristic core mass, 1-7 ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;, are consistent with predictions of thermal Jeans fragmentation. The three clouds showing fragmentation may be forming OB associations (stellar mass ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;). None of the four clouds under investigation seem to be currently able to form massive star clusters like the Arches and the Quintuplet (≳10<SUP>4</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;), but they may form such clusters by further gas accretion onto the cores.",2020,"The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), is a star-forming environment with extreme physical properties.

Theories have suggested an episodic star formation cycle which is at its near-minimum now. Our VLA and SMA observations towards a sample of four CMZ clouds have detected a population of protostellar candidates, traced by gravitationally bound dense cores and H2O masers.

We do not find evidence of disagreement between relative molecular abundances in these outflows and in nearby analogs such as the well-studied L1157 and NGC 7538S outflows. The results suggest that (i) protostellar accretion disks driving outflows ubiquitously exist in the CMZ environment, (ii) the large fraction of candidate starless cores is expected if these clouds are at very early evolutionary phases, with a caveat on the potential incompleteness of the outflows, (iii) high-mass and low-mass star formation is ongoing simultaneously in these clouds, and (iv) current data do not show evidence of a difference between the shock chemistry in the outflows that determines the molecular abundances in the CMZ environment and in nearby clouds. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 continuum observations of 2000 au resolution toward four massive molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy. To study gas fragmentation, we use the dendrogram method to identify cores as traced by the dust continuum emission. The four clouds exhibit different fragmentation states at the observed resolution despite having similar masses at the cloud scale (∼1-5 pc). Assuming a constant dust temperature of 20 K, we construct core mass functions of the clouds and find a slightly top-heavy shape as compared to the canonical initial mass function, but we note several significant uncertainties that may affect this result. The characteristic spatial separation between the cores as identified by the minimum spanning tree method, ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> au, and the characteristic core mass, 1-7 ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;, are consistent with predictions of thermal Jeans fragmentation. The three clouds showing fragmentation may be forming OB associations (stellar mass ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;).

C.; Kauffmann, Jens; Cheng, Yu; Inutsuka, Shu-ichiro","We observe 1.3 mm spectral lines at 2000 au resolution toward four massive molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy to investigate their star formation activities. We focus on several potential shock tracers that are usually abundant in protostellar outflows, including SiO, SO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, HC<SUB>3</SUB>N, and HNCO. We identify 43 protostellar outflows, including 37 highly likely ones and 6 candidates. The outflows are found toward both known high-mass star-forming cores and less massive, seemingly quiescent cores, while 791 out of the 834 cores identified based on the continuum do not have detected outflows. The outflow masses range from less than 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to a few tens of M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with typical uncertainties of a factor of 70. We do not find evidence of disagreement between relative molecular abundances in these outflows and in nearby analogs such as the well-studied L1157 and NGC 7538S outflows. The results suggest that (i) protostellar accretion disks driving outflows ubiquitously exist in the CMZ environment, (ii) the large fraction of candidate starless cores is expected if these clouds are at very early evolutionary phases, with a caveat on the potential incompleteness of the outflows, (iii) high-mass and low-mass star formation is ongoing simultaneously in these clouds, and (iv) current data do not show evidence of a difference between the shock chemistry in the outflows that determines the molecular abundances in the CMZ environment and in nearby clouds. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 continuum observations of 2000 au resolution toward four massive molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy. To study gas fragmentation, we use the dendrogram method to identify cores as traced by the dust continuum emission. The four clouds exhibit different fragmentation states at the observed resolution despite having similar masses at the cloud scale (∼1-5 pc). Assuming a constant dust temperature of 20 K, we construct core mass functions of the clouds and find a slightly top-heavy shape as compared to the canonical initial mass function, but we note several significant uncertainties that may affect this result. The characteristic spatial separation between the cores as identified by the minimum spanning tree method, ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> au, and the characteristic core mass, 1-7 ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;, are consistent with predictions of thermal Jeans fragmentation. The three clouds showing fragmentation may be forming OB associations (stellar mass ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;). None of the four clouds under investigation seem to be currently able to form massive star clusters like the Arches and the Quintuplet (≳10<SUP>4</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;), but they may form such clusters by further gas accretion onto the cores.",2020,"The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), is a star-forming environment with extreme physical properties. Despite its large reservoir of dense gas, the CMZ appears to have a much lower current star formation rate than what the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation predicts. Theories have suggested an episodic star formation cycle which is at its near-minimum now. Our VLA and SMA observations towards a sample of four CMZ clouds have detected a population of protostellar candidates, traced by gravitationally bound dense cores and H2O masers. They may suggest an increase of current star formation than in the last few million years, consistent with the episodic star formation mode in the CMZ. However the existing data cannot confirm definitely the protostellar nature of these candidates. We propose to use ALMA, with its unprecedented capability of high sensitivity and high dynamic range, to observe these protostellar candidates.

We focus on several potential shock tracers that are usually abundant in protostellar outflows, including SiO, SO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, HC<SUB>3</SUB>N, and HNCO. We identify 43 protostellar outflows, including 37 highly likely ones and 6 candidates. The outflows are found toward both known high-mass star-forming cores and less massive, seemingly quiescent cores, while 791 out of the 834 cores identified based on the continuum do not have detected outflows. The outflow masses range from less than 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to a few tens of M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with typical uncertainties of a factor of 70. We do not find evidence of disagreement between relative molecular abundances in these outflows and in nearby analogs such as the well-studied L1157 and NGC 7538S outflows. The results suggest that (i) protostellar accretion disks driving outflows ubiquitously exist in the CMZ environment, (ii) the large fraction of candidate starless cores is expected if these clouds are at very early evolutionary phases, with a caveat on the potential incompleteness of the outflows, (iii) high-mass and low-mass star formation is ongoing simultaneously in these clouds, and (iv) current data do not show evidence of a difference between the shock chemistry in the outflows that determines the molecular abundances in the CMZ environment and in nearby clouds. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 continuum observations of 2000 au resolution toward four massive molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy. To study gas fragmentation, we use the dendrogram method to identify cores as traced by the dust continuum emission. The four clouds exhibit different fragmentation states at the observed resolution despite having similar masses at the cloud scale (∼1-5 pc). Assuming a constant dust temperature of 20 K, we construct core mass functions of the clouds and find a slightly top-heavy shape as compared to the canonical initial mass function, but we note several significant uncertainties that may affect this result. The characteristic spatial separation between the cores as identified by the minimum spanning tree method, ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> au, and the characteristic core mass, 1-7 ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;, are consistent with predictions of thermal Jeans fragmentation. The three clouds showing fragmentation may be forming OB associations (stellar mass ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;). None of the four clouds under investigation seem to be currently able to form massive star clusters like the Arches and the Quintuplet (≳10<SUP>4</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ &lt;!-- --&gt;), but they may form such clusters by further gas accretion onto the cores.",2020,"The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), is a star-forming environment with extreme physical properties. Despite its large reservoir of dense gas, the CMZ appears to have a much lower current star formation rate than what the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation predicts. Theories have suggested an episodic star formation cycle which is at its near-minimum now. Our VLA and SMA observations towards a sample of four CMZ clouds have detected a population of protostellar candidates, traced by gravitationally bound dense cores and H2O masers. They may suggest an increase of current star formation than in the last few million years, consistent with the episodic star formation mode in the CMZ. However the existing data cannot confirm definitely the protostellar nature of these candidates. We propose to use ALMA, with its unprecedented capability of high sensitivity and high dynamic range, to observe these protostellar candidates. The project, aiming at detecting compact CH3CN emission from natal hot molecular cores, will confirm or reject the presence of embedded protostars. The new observations will provide us a vision of the episodic star formation in the CMZ.",the_20_k_a_06_TM2,"Longmore, Steven; Kauffmann, Jens; Lu, Xing; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Kruijssen, Diederik; Pillai, Thushara; Battersby, Cara;",2.123252991215672,0.06694827474193507,0.25221914052963257,uid://A001/X88f/X296,uid://A001/X88f/X299,uid://A002/Xbfb22d/X909a,Confirming Deeply Embedded Protostellar Population in the Central Molecular Zone,S,TARGET,T,6.4325388587138335,1875000000.0,A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A006:DV15 A007:DV04 A009:DV18 A010:DV23 A011:DV03 A015:DA61 A020:DV06 A021:DA44 A023:DA51 A027:DA56 A029:DA60 A034:DA46 A036:DV20 A046:DA50 A047:DA62 A051:DA63 A053:DV14 A060:DV25 A061:DV01 A062:DV05 A063:DA45 A064:DA42 A065:DA64 A067:DV12 A068:DV13 A069:DA55 A070:DA48 A071:DA52 A072:DA53 A073:DV22 A074:DA47 A075:DV11 A076:DV17 A077:DV24 A078:DV08 A079:DA54 A080:DV07,T,2018-05-29T21:58:55.000,0.6941996969921467,"[216.95..218.83GHz,1128.91kHz,2.1mJy/beam@10km/s,132.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [219.04..220.91GHz,1128.91kHz,2.1mJy/beam@10km/s,132.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.15..233.02GHz,1128.91kHz,2.1mJy/beam@10km/s,133.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [233.15..235.02GHz,1128.91kHz,2.1mJy/beam@10km/s,138.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.8912632067495,1451.4435281984668,"Zhang, Qizhou",ALMA Observations of Massive Clouds in the Central Molecular Zone: Jeans Fragmentation and Cluster Formation ALMA Observations of Massive Clouds in the Central Molecular Zone: Ubiquitous Protostellar Outflows,"Lu, Xing",T,2020ApJ...894L..14L 2021ApJ...909..177L,High-mass star formation,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (5-4)

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium.

This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large.

These data will provide a unique test for star formation theories in such extreme regimes and allow us to place constraints on the dominant physical mechanisms governing the formation of the most massive stars.",d_sma1_a_06_TM2,"Alves, Joao; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Johnston, Katharine; Lu, Xing; Jackson, James; Garay, Guido; Rathborne, Jill; Ginsburg, Adam; Longmore, Steven; Zhang, Qizhou; Barnes, Ashley; Kauffmann, Jens; Gomez, Laura; Keto, Eric; Mills, Elisabeth; Battersby, Cara; Foster, Jonathan; Ho, Luis; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett; Bastian, Nate; Pillai, Thushara;",0.5791652139395099,0.02040545190920124,1.1434595584869385,uid://A001/X87d/X138,uid://A001/X87d/X13b,uid://A002/Xbf9c0a/X324d,Uncovering the Early Formation of Extremely Massive Stars,S,TARGET,T,6.421975142566689,937500000.0,A002:DA49 A004:DA41 A006:DV15 A007:DV04 A009:DV18 A010:DV23 A011:DV03 A015:DA61 A020:DV06 A021:DA44 A023:DA51 A027:DA56 A029:DA60 A034:DA46 A036:DV20 A037:DV19 A046:DA50 A047:DA62 A048:DV10 A049:DA57 A051:DA63 A053:DV14 A060:DV25 A061:DV01 A062:DV05 A063:DA45 A064:DA42 A065:DA64 A067:DV12 A068:DV13 A069:DA55 A071:DA52 A072:DA53 A073:DV22 A074:DA47 A075:DV11 A076:DV17 A077:DV24 A078:DV08 A079:DA54 A080:DV07,F,2018-05-10T03:36:08.000,0.6871572387553377,"[216.97..217.21GHz,564.45kHz,582.9uJy/beam@10km/s,102.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.09..218.32GHz,564.45kHz,581.8uJy/beam@10km/s,102.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.34..218.58GHz,564.45kHz,581.5uJy/beam@10km/s,102.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [218.63..218.86GHz,564.45kHz,581.2uJy/beam@10km/s,102.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [220.23..221.16GHz,564.45kHz,579.2uJy/beam@10km/s,51.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [231.55..233.42GHz,1938.48kHz,542.4uJy/beam@10km/s,34.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [234.05..235.92GHz,1938.48kHz,540.2uJy/beam@10km/s,34.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",220.69412348057475,765.0463638252047,"Walker, Daniel",Star formation in 'the Brick': ALMA reveals an active protocluster in the Galactic centre cloud G0.253+0.016 The initial conditions for young massive cluster formation in the Galactic Centre: convergence of large-scale gas flows,"Walker, Daniel L.

It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions.

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF).

The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF).

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

Aminoacetonitrile, a molecule detected in the interstellar medium only toward the star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), is considered an important prebiotic species; in particular, it is a possible precursor of the simplest amino acid glycine. To date, observations have been limited to ground state emission lines, whereas transitions from within vibrationally excited states remained undetected. <BR /> Aims: We wanted to accurately determine the energies of the low-lying vibrational states of aminoacetonitrile, which are expected to be populated in Sgr B2(N1), the main hot core of Sgr B2(N). This step is fundamental in order to properly evaluate the vibration-rotation partition function of aminoacetonitrile as well as the line strengths of the rotational transitions of its vibrationally excited states. This is necessary to derive accurate column densities and secure the identification of these transitions in astronomical spectra. <BR /> Methods: The far-infrared ro-vibrational spectrum of aminoacetonitrile has been recorded in absorption against a synchrotron source of continuum emission. Three bands, corresponding to the lowest vibrational modes of aminoacetonitrile, were observed in the frequency region below 500 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.

Aminoacetonitrile, a molecule detected in the interstellar medium only toward the star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), is considered an important prebiotic species; in particular, it is a possible precursor of the simplest amino acid glycine. To date, observations have been limited to ground state emission lines, whereas transitions from within vibrationally excited states remained undetected. <BR /> Aims: We wanted to accurately determine the energies of the low-lying vibrational states of aminoacetonitrile, which are expected to be populated in Sgr B2(N1), the main hot core of Sgr B2(N). This step is fundamental in order to properly evaluate the vibration-rotation partition function of aminoacetonitrile as well as the line strengths of the rotational transitions of its vibrationally excited states. This is necessary to derive accurate column densities and secure the identification of these transitions in astronomical spectra. <BR /> Methods: The far-infrared ro-vibrational spectrum of aminoacetonitrile has been recorded in absorption against a synchrotron source of continuum emission. Three bands, corresponding to the lowest vibrational modes of aminoacetonitrile, were observed in the frequency region below 500 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The combined analysis of ro-vibrational and pure rotational data allowed us to prepare new spectral line catalogs for all the states under investigation. We used the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA performed with ALMA to search for vibrationally excited aminoacetonitrile toward Sgr B2(N1).

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars.

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds. The observations requested here will constitute the most comprehensive survey of CMZ molecular clouds yet.

The CND consists of several molecular cores with sizes of 0.1 pc. The CND, being the final place of the molecular reservoir in the Galactic center (GC), is critical to our understanding of the feeding of SgrA*. Additionally, knowing the life time of the CND is paramount. Two key factors control this life time: (1) the tidal threshold by SgrA* exerted on the gas, and (2) replenishment from exterior gas inflows. Earlier low-resolution (beam > 24) data suggest that the CND is transient because of its low density. High-resolution (0.1 pc) data are awaited to confirm this. We found a molecular streamer, originating from the ambient clouds with progressively higher velocities as it approaches the CND, in our CS(2-1) map (beam=40"" (1.5 pc)).

Aminoacetonitrile, a molecule detected in the interstellar medium only toward the star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), is considered an important prebiotic species; in particular, it is a possible precursor of the simplest amino acid glycine. To date, observations have been limited to ground state emission lines, whereas transitions from within vibrationally excited states remained undetected. <BR /> Aims: We wanted to accurately determine the energies of the low-lying vibrational states of aminoacetonitrile, which are expected to be populated in Sgr B2(N1), the main hot core of Sgr B2(N). This step is fundamental in order to properly evaluate the vibration-rotation partition function of aminoacetonitrile as well as the line strengths of the rotational transitions of its vibrationally excited states. This is necessary to derive accurate column densities and secure the identification of these transitions in astronomical spectra. <BR /> Methods: The far-infrared ro-vibrational spectrum of aminoacetonitrile has been recorded in absorption against a synchrotron source of continuum emission. Three bands, corresponding to the lowest vibrational modes of aminoacetonitrile, were observed in the frequency region below 500 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The combined analysis of ro-vibrational and pure rotational data allowed us to prepare new spectral line catalogs for all the states under investigation. We used the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA performed with ALMA to search for vibrationally excited aminoacetonitrile toward Sgr B2(N1). The astronomical spectra were analyzed under the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation. <BR /> Results: Almost 11 000 lines have been assigned during the analysis of the laboratory spectrum of aminoacetonitrile, thanks to which the vibrational energies of the v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1, v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1, and v<SUB>17</SUB> = 1 states have been determined. The whole dataset, which includes high J and K<SUB>a</SUB> transitions, is well reproduced within the experimental accuracy. Reliable spectral predictions of pure rotational lines can now be produced up to the THz region. On the basis of these spectroscopic predictions, we report the interstellar detection of aminoacetonitrile in its v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 vibrational states toward Sgr B2(N1) in addition to emission from its vibrational ground state. The intensities of the identified v<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 and v<SUB>18</SUB> = 1 lines are consistent with the detected v = 0 lines under LTE at a temperature of 200 K for an aminoacetonitrile column density of 1.1 × 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: This work shows the strong interplay between laboratory spectroscopy exploiting (sub)millimeter and synchrotron-based far-infrared techniques, and observational spectral surveys to detect complex organic molecules in space and quantify their abundances. <P />The list of assigned transitions is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/641/A160</A> ...(6)",2019,"ALMA has had a transformational effect on the search for complex organic molecules (COMs) in star-forming regions, pushing the limits of observable chemical complexity. Our recent detection of a branched alkyl molecule in the interstellar medium (ISM) with ALMA has opened a new domain in the structures available to the chemistry of star-forming regions, beyond simple chains. Our astrochemical model was recently expanded to include branched isomers, and indicates that branched molecules may be dominant in star-forming regions where the chemistry is of sufficient complexity. We propose to perform a direct observational test of this hypothesis, in order to determine both the degree and the manner in which chemical complexity evolves during star formation. We propose to search for n-butyl cyanide and its three branched isomers toward Sgr B2(N), the most fruitful target for new detections of COMs in the ISM. The discovery of biologically-relevant molecules in the ISM is of high scientific impact.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars.

The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding.

The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*. (3) Fit the inflow kinematics to constrain theoretical models for their dynamics and fates.",cnd_cs76_d_07_7M,"Wang, Hsiang-Hsu; Tang, Ya-Wen; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick; Harada, Nanase; Kim, Woong-Tae;",93.38143451587443,3.089490836845226,0.9100000262260437,uid://A001/X1284/X1717,uid://A001/X1284/X171a,uid://A002/Xc96f17/X5ec2,Replenishing Molecular Gas Near the Supermassive Black Hole SgrA*,S,TARGET,T,20.794228916744537,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2020-01-09T00:00:00.000,2.6717635525594106,"[341.80..343.80GHz,1128.91kHz,78.2mJy/beam@10km/s,5.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [343.69..345.69GHz,1128.91kHz,72.9mJy/beam@10km/s,5.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [353.80..355.80GHz,1128.91kHz,83.6mJy/beam@10km/s,6.4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [355.50..357.50GHz,1128.91kHz,93.4mJy/beam@10km/s,7.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",356.5001119051025,951.8756198120107,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments.

P.; Tang, Ya-Wen; Beck, Sara","Utilizing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we present CS line maps in five rotational lines (J<SUB>u</SUB> = 7, 5, 4, 3, 2) toward the circumnuclear disk (CND) and streamers of the Galactic center. Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND.

Since the cloud is not associated with any visible energy sources capable of producing the observed fast turbulence, its nature remains unknown. Recently, an interesting hypothesis has been proposed, which claims that the broad emission comes from gas trailing from a clump gravitationally kicked by an intermediate-mass blackhole (IMBH) of 1e5 Msun. However, the follow-up observation with ALMA has raised several question on the fundamental assumptions made in the IMBH hypothesis, as it failed to detect clear signature of the hypothesized trailing gas.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales.

Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds.

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2. We report the discovery of molecular gas streams orbiting around an invisible massive object in the central region of our Galaxy, based on the high-resolution molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The morphology and kinematics of these streams can be reproduced well through two Keplerian orbits around a single point mass of (3.2 ± 0.6) × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB>. We also found ionized gas toward the inner part of the orbiting gas, indicating dissociative shock and/or photoionization. Our results provide new circumstantial evidences for a wandering intermediate-mass black hole in the Galactic center, suggesting also that high-velocity compact clouds can be probes of quiescent black holes that abound in our Galaxy. We report the results of high-resolution molecular line observations of the high-velocity compact cloud HCN─0.085─0.094 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The HCN J = 4─3, HCO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 4─3, and CS J = 7─6 line images reveal that HCN─0.085─0.094 consists mainly of three small clumps with extremely broad velocity widths. Each of the three clumps has a 5.5 GHz radio continuum counterpart in its periphery toward Sgr A*. The positional relationship indicates that their surfaces have been ionized by ultraviolet photons from young stars in the central cluster, suggesting the clumps are in close proximity to the Galactic nucleus. One of the three clumps has a ring-like structure with a very steep velocity gradient. This kinematical structure suggests an orbit around a point-like object with a mass of ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>. The absence of stellar counterparts indicates that the point-like object may be a quiescent black hole.

In order to uncover the nature and the origin of these sHVCCs, we propose high-resolution observations in HCN J=4-3 and H26 alpha lines. The possible origin of the sHVCCs is (1) outflow from a deeply embedded massive protostar, (2) supernova explosion in the recent past, (3) cloud-cloud collision, or (4) high-velocity plunge of an invisible massive compact object into a molecular cloud.

Since the cloud is not associated with any visible energy sources capable of producing the observed fast turbulence, its nature remains unknown. Recently, an interesting hypothesis has been proposed, which claims that the broad emission comes from gas trailing from a clump gravitationally kicked by an intermediate-mass blackhole (IMBH) of 1e5 Msun. However, the follow-up observation with ALMA has raised several question on the fundamental assumptions made in the IMBH hypothesis, as it failed to detect clear signature of the hypothesized trailing gas.

Since the cloud is not associated with any visible energy sources capable of producing the observed fast turbulence, its nature remains unknown. Recently, an interesting hypothesis has been proposed, which claims that the broad emission comes from gas trailing from a clump gravitationally kicked by an intermediate-mass blackhole (IMBH) of 1e5 Msun. However, the follow-up observation with ALMA has raised several question on the fundamental assumptions made in the IMBH hypothesis, as it failed to detect clear signature of the hypothesized trailing gas.

Since the cloud is not associated with any visible energy sources capable of producing the observed fast turbulence, its nature remains unknown. Recently, an interesting hypothesis has been proposed, which claims that the broad emission comes from gas trailing from a clump gravitationally kicked by an intermediate-mass blackhole (IMBH) of 1e5 Msun. However, the follow-up observation with ALMA has raised several question on the fundamental assumptions made in the IMBH hypothesis, as it failed to detect clear signature of the hypothesized trailing gas.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales.

Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation.

A massive dense clump precursor must be assembled and kept stable against fragmentation long enough to form massive stars, and a mechanism must be provided to trigger the formation of a top-heavy IMF cluster. The 100-pc ring of dense and cold clouds orbiting around the Galactic Center (Molinari et al. 2011) may offer both conditions: it hosts the best candidate for Arches-like precursor (Longmore et al. 2012), as well as the best example of a cloud-collision induced burst of star formation (Sgr B2). To test our hypothesis that the ring is the structure that channels material into high-mass prestellar clumps, we obtained Cycle 3 ALMA 12m-array priority ""A"" time to carry out a continuum and line survey of the denser clumps (Av > 50 mag) along the 100-pc ring.

P.; Tang, Ya-Wen; Beck, Sara","Utilizing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we present CS line maps in five rotational lines (J<SUB>u</SUB> = 7, 5, 4, 3, 2) toward the circumnuclear disk (CND) and streamers of the Galactic center. Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*. (3) Fit the inflow kinematics to constrain theoretical models for their dynamics and fates.",cnd_cs76_b_07_7M,"Wang, Hsiang-Hsu; Tang, Ya-Wen; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick; Harada, Nanase; Kim, Woong-Tae;",91.66695673197772,3.026712133511842,0.9100000262260437,uid://A001/X1284/X1703,uid://A001/X1284/X1706,uid://A002/Xc96463/X597e,Replenishing Molecular Gas Near the Supermassive Black Hole SgrA*,S,TARGET,T,19.99086900233741,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2020-01-11T00:00:00.000,3.04095033847606,"[341.80..343.80GHz,1128.91kHz,76.5mJy/beam@10km/s,5.8mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [343.69..345.69GHz,1128.91kHz,71.4mJy/beam@10km/s,5.4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [353.80..355.80GHz,1128.91kHz,82.1mJy/beam@10km/s,6.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [355.50..357.50GHz,1128.91kHz,91.7mJy/beam@10km/s,7.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",356.50006881469096,951.8757976630285,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales.

Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*.

The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*. (3) Fit the inflow kinematics to constrain theoretical models for their dynamics and fates.",cnd_cs54_c_06_TP,"Wang, Hsiang-Hsu; Tang, Ya-Wen; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick; Harada, Nanase; Kim, Woong-Tae;",10.334215588988432,0.3153301360729707,1.782606840133667,uid://A001/X1284/X16e5,uid://A001/X12a3/X146,uid://A002/Xc9831a/X6d48,Replenishing Molecular Gas Near the Supermassive Black Hole SgrA*,S,TARGET,T,369.7911026732289,2000000000.0,T701:PM02 T702:PM03 T703:PM01 T704:PM04,F,2019-03-21T22:30:53.000,20.862094203072512,"[242.50..244.50GHz,1938.48kHz,10.2mJy/beam@10km/s,649uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [244.00..246.00GHz,1128.91kHz,8.8mJy/beam@10km/s,565.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [257.50..259.50GHz,1128.91kHz,9.8mJy/beam@10km/s,645.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [259.39..261.39GHz,1128.91kHz,10.3mJy/beam@10km/s,681uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",260.39064972245285,1304.5637717014104,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA.

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"Thanks to space and stratospheric telescopes (Herschel, SOFIA) and to hard-core radiative transfer modeling we have been able to acquire a detailed knowledge on the whereabouts of gaseous H2O and, by proxy, of elemental oxygen in the Sagittarius B2 complex. Our three-dimensional model of ~70 rotational transitions of H2O and its isotopologues yields [H2O]/[H2]~10^(-6). However, with increasing gas temperatures we expect H2O to account for about 50% of the total oxygen (the other half being tied in CO). If our assumptions on oxygen chemistry are correct, we would expect [H2O]/[H2]~10^{-4} in the vicinities of the hot cores. With this experiment we want to put this assumption to the test. We think that our Herschel data cannot answer this question, because of the combined effect of large beam and high dust opacity. We propose to observe vibrationally excited H2O and H218O at 658 and 647 GHz with the ALMA 12-m array towards Sgr B2(M) and (N). These transitions lie ~2400 K above ground and, with our desired spatial resolution of 0.22"", we will catch a glimpse of the inner 0.01 pc of the cores, and finally determine the whereabouts of elemental oxygen in dense hot gas.",SgrB2_M_a_09_TM1,"Schilke, Peter; Schmiedeke, Anika; Bergin, Edwin; Sanchez-Monge, Alvaro; Ceccarelli, Cecilia;",10.678237914137805,0.5487824655296412,0.46716925501823425,uid://A001/X1273/X41e,uid://A001/X1273/X41f,uid://A002/Xcccc19/Xa471,Where's the oxygen in Sgr B2?,S,TARGET,T,3.013324703582027,1875000000.0,A001:DV07 A002:DA46 A003:DV12 A006:DA61 A007:DV05 A008:DA42 A009:DV18 A010:DA50 A011:DV21 A015:DA64 A016:DA44 A017:DA56 A019:DA58 A022:DV23 A023:DA41 A024:DA49 A025:DV02 A026:DA57 A027:DV06 A033:DA53 A034:DA55 A035:DA47 A039:DV14 A040:DA51 A041:DV19 A042:DV08 A043:DA60 A044:DV11 A045:DV01 A047:DV15 A048:DA62 A049:DV03 A058:DA43 A060:DV17 A068:DA65 A069:DV16 A070:DV22 A072:DV20 A073:DA54 A074:DV09 A075:DA52 A076:DA59 A082:DV24 A083:DA48 A085:DA63 A088:DV04,F,2020-07-09T00:00:00.000,0.2373287045171085,"[643.82..645.69GHz,1128.91kHz,9.8mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [646.12..648.00GHz,1128.91kHz,9.8mJy/beam@10km/s,1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [656.93..658.80GHz,1128.91kHz,10.7mJy/beam@10km/s,1.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [659.99..661.86GHz,1128.91kHz,10.7mJy/beam@10km/s,1.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",660.9262395915121,512.7390423130926,"Comito, Claudia",ALMACAL - VI.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>).

A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium.

These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions.

Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. We present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13 arcsec (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core' and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016. We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ∼2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multidirectional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate- and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments. Young massive clusters (YMCs) are compact (≲1 pc), high-mass (&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stellar systems of significant scientific interest. Due to their rarity and rapid formation, we have very few examples of YMC progenitor gas clouds before star formation has begun. As a result, the initial conditions required for YMC formation are uncertain. We present high resolution (0.13 arcsec, ~1000 au) ALMA observations and Mopra single-dish data, showing that Galactic Centre dust ridge 'Cloud d' (G0.412 + 0.052, mass = 7.6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius = 3.2 pc) has the potential to become an Arches-like YMC (10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, r ~ 1 pc), but is not yet forming stars. This would mean it is the youngest known pre-star-forming massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum, with masses ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> au. The source masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates is large. We find evidence for large-scale (~1 pc) converging gas flows, which could cause the cloud to grow rapidly, gaining 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find no high-mass starless cores. If the sources represent the initial conditions for star formation, the resulting initial mass function will be bottom heavy.",2021,"The huge amounts of energy and momentum that very massive stars expel has a significant effect on the physical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium. Yet despite on-going efforts, their formation remains poorly understood due to the rarity of their progenitors. This proposal aims to advance this understanding by targeting four recently-identified high-mass cores in the Central Molecular Zone. These cores all contain > 100 Msun within radii < 0.1 pc and are young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are all prime candidates for representing the initial conditions of very high-mass stars. Furthermore, each core displays differing amounts of star-formation activity, potentially providing a unique evolutionary sequence of massive star formation under the same environmental conditions. ALMA's unparalleled sensitivity at high angular resolution will allow us to resolve the structures within these cores down to 1000 AU -- a predicted fragmentation scale for high-mass stars.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*. (3) Fit the inflow kinematics to constrain theoretical models for their dynamics and fates.",cnd_cs76_a_07_7M,"Wang, Hsiang-Hsu; Tang, Ya-Wen; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick; Harada, Nanase; Kim, Woong-Tae;",86.5721225720673,2.874547745633772,0.9100000262260437,uid://A001/X1284/X16f9,uid://A001/X1284/X16fc,uid://A002/Xc53e4e/X704,Replenishing Molecular Gas Near the Supermassive Black Hole SgrA*,S,TARGET,T,21.559491461528772,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2019-11-05T00:00:00.000,2.7346013527122626,"[341.80..343.80GHz,1128.91kHz,73.1mJy/beam@10km/s,5.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [343.69..345.69GHz,1128.91kHz,67.6mJy/beam@10km/s,5.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [353.80..355.80GHz,1128.91kHz,77.9mJy/beam@10km/s,6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [355.50..357.50GHz,1128.91kHz,86.6mJy/beam@10km/s,6.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",356.50008139715675,951.9805314454261,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA.

P.; Tang, Ya-Wen; Beck, Sara","Utilizing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we present CS line maps in five rotational lines (J<SUB>u</SUB> = 7, 5, 4, 3, 2) toward the circumnuclear disk (CND) and streamers of the Galactic center. Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*. (3) Fit the inflow kinematics to constrain theoretical models for their dynamics and fates.",cnd_cs76_a_07_7M,"Wang, Hsiang-Hsu; Tang, Ya-Wen; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick; Harada, Nanase; Kim, Woong-Tae;",77.91445639725661,2.874547745633772,0.9100000262260437,uid://A001/X1284/X16f9,uid://A001/X1284/X16fc,uid://A002/Xc53e4e/X704,Replenishing Molecular Gas Near the Supermassive Black Hole SgrA*,S,TARGET,T,21.559491461528772,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2019-11-05T00:00:00.000,2.7346013527122626,"[341.80..343.80GHz,1128.91kHz,73.1mJy/beam@10km/s,5.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [343.69..345.69GHz,1128.91kHz,67.6mJy/beam@10km/s,5.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [353.80..355.80GHz,1128.91kHz,77.9mJy/beam@10km/s,6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [355.50..357.50GHz,1128.91kHz,86.6mJy/beam@10km/s,6.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",354.79631247328814,951.9805314454261,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*. (3) Fit the inflow kinematics to constrain theoretical models for their dynamics and fates.",cnd_cs21_a_03_TM2,"Wang, Hsiang-Hsu; Tang, Ya-Wen; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick; Harada, Nanase; Kim, Woong-Tae;",8.195028446745189,0.32040680993685494,1.0557295083999634,uid://A001/X1284/X16bb,uid://A001/X1284/X16be,uid://A002/Xce574d/X16ec,Replenishing Molecular Gas Near the Supermassive Black Hole SgrA*,S,TARGET,T,23.9292727871203,468750000.0,A001:DV07 A002:DA46 A003:DV12 A004:DA52 A005:DV25 A006:DA61 A007:DV05 A008:DA42 A010:DA50 A011:DV21 A013:DV24 A015:DA64 A016:DA44 A017:DA56 A018:DV13 A019:DA58 A022:DV23 A023:DA41 A024:DA49 A026:DA57 A027:DV06 A028:DA63 A030:DA59 A031:DA48 A033:DA53 A034:DA55 A035:DA47 A036:DA45 A038:DV22 A039:DV14 A040:DA51 A041:DV19 A042:DV08 A044:DV11 A045:DV01 A046:DA54 A047:DV15 A048:DA62 A049:DV03 A058:DA43 A060:DV17 A062:DV10 A066:DV04 A068:DA65 A072:DV20 A074:DV09 T701:PM02 T702:PM03 T703:PM01 T704:PM04,T,2019-06-11T19:32:26.000,2.483583525783341,"[85.97..86.43GHz,282.23kHz,8.3mJy/beam@10km/s,650.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.37..88.83GHz,282.23kHz,8.2mJy/beam@10km/s,650.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.77..98.23GHz,282.23kHz,7.6mJy/beam@10km/s,631.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.77..100.23GHz,282.23kHz,7.5mJy/beam@10km/s,631.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",88.6000007638741,848.033008588355,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA.

Since the cloud is not associated with any visible energy sources capable of producing the observed fast turbulence, its nature remains unknown. Recently, an interesting hypothesis has been proposed, which claims that the broad emission comes from gas trailing from a clump gravitationally kicked by an intermediate-mass blackhole (IMBH) of 1e5 Msun. However, the follow-up observation with ALMA has raised several question on the fundamental assumptions made in the IMBH hypothesis, as it failed to detect clear signature of the hypothesized trailing gas. To address this problem, we propose to perform new multi-line imaging observations of the cloud in Bands-6 and -7.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"Thanks to space and stratospheric telescopes (Herschel, SOFIA) and to hard-core radiative transfer modeling we have been able to acquire a detailed knowledge on the whereabouts of gaseous H2O and, by proxy, of elemental oxygen in the Sagittarius B2 complex. Our three-dimensional model of ~70 rotational transitions of H2O and its isotopologues yields [H2O]/[H2]~10^(-6). However, with increasing gas temperatures we expect H2O to account for about 50% of the total oxygen (the other half being tied in CO). If our assumptions on oxygen chemistry are correct, we would expect [H2O]/[H2]~10^{-4} in the vicinities of the hot cores. With this experiment we want to put this assumption to the test. We think that our Herschel data cannot answer this question, because of the combined effect of large beam and high dust opacity. We propose to observe vibrationally excited H2O and H218O at 658 and 647 GHz with the ALMA 12-m array towards Sgr B2(M) and (N).

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales.

Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND.

This component is barely resolved at 0.2"" beam and shows significant variations during 4 separate epochs spanning 2 months. In particular, a narrow absorption feature is seen to shift in velocity by about 25 km/s during this period. The motion is consistent with a neutral dense cloud orbiting SgrA*, and could be associated with the G2 cloud infalling towards SgrA*. Because of its high velocity and faint intensity, this feature has never been seen before. In this cycle, we request 4 further epochs of observations to be separated on the order of 2 months again to trace the dynamics.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales.

Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds.

Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND.

P.; Tang, Ya-Wen; Beck, Sara","Utilizing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we present CS line maps in five rotational lines (J<SUB>u</SUB> = 7, 5, 4, 3, 2) toward the circumnuclear disk (CND) and streamers of the Galactic center. Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution (1""3 = 0.05 pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05-0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>FWHM</SUB> = 5-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≥ 50-500 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and cold gas (T<SUB>k</SUB> ≤ 50 K, ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ = 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that ${84}_{-37}^{+16} \% $ of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10-100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore it inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present CS(7-6) line maps toward the central parsec of the Galactic center, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The primary goal is to find and characterize the gas structure in the inner cavity of the circumnuclear disk (CND) in high resolution (1.″3 = 0.05 pc). Our large field-of-view mosaic maps—combining interferometric and single-dish data that recover extended emission—provide a first homogeneous look to resolve and link the molecular streamers in the CND with the neutral nuclear filaments newly detected within the central cavity of the CND. We find that the nuclear filaments are rotating with Keplerian velocities in a nearly face-on orbit with an inclination angle of ̃10°-20° (radius ≤ 0.5 pc). This is in contrast to the CND which is highly inclined at ̃65°-80° (radius ̃2-5 pc). Our analysis suggests a highly warped structure from the CND to the nuclear filaments. This result may hint that the nuclear filaments and the CND were created by different external clouds passing by Sgr A*.",2019,"The detection of the 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), SgrA*, provides an unique laboratory to study SMBH accretion at sub-pc scales. Theoretical model predicts that the CND was formed through the tidal disruption of nearby molecular clouds. Indeed, our previous CS(2-1) and HCN(4-3) maps with ALMA and SMA revealed that the streamers surrounding the CND are the tidal debris captured from the nearby clouds. The streamers show inflow motion and finally ends up co-rotating with the CND. We also found that the key elements - compact cores - inside the streamers may be the infall seeds or the sites of star formation. We propose to obtain a 0.5""-1"" resolution map with the 5 CS lines to resolve the compact cores in the streamers and the CND. With the unprecedented ALMA maps, we will, (1) Measure the CND and streamers mass ratios to evaluate the importance of the inflow and SMBH feeding. (2) Measure the densities and sizes of the compact cores to derive the ""surviving fraction"" as a function of distance to SgrA*. (3) Fit the inflow kinematics to constrain theoretical models for their dynamics and fates.",cnd_cs21_a_03_TM1,"Wang, Hsiang-Hsu; Tang, Ya-Wen; Ho, Paul; Koch, Patrick; Harada, Nanase; Kim, Woong-Tae;",6.929254077015065,0.2744999621947671,1.1952874660491943,uid://A001/X1284/X16bb,uid://A001/X1284/X16bc,uid://A002/Xc845c0/X317f,Replenishing Molecular Gas Near the Supermassive Black Hole SgrA*,S,TARGET,T,6.668081092897377,468750000.0,A007:DV05 A015:DA64 A022:DV23 A024:DA49 A027:DV06 A033:DA53 A043:DA60 A045:DV01 A047:DV15 A060:DV17 A062:DV10 A068:DA65 A069:DV16 A070:DV22 A072:DV20 A073:DA54 A074:DV09 A075:DA52 A076:DA59 A082:DV24 A083:DA48 A085:DA63 A087:DV25 A089:DA61 A090:DA56 A092:DV14 A093:DA57 A094:DV19 A101:DA62 A104:DA51 A110:DA41 A115:DA43 A116:DV07 A120:DA44 A121:DA55 A122:DV11 A123:DA42 A128:DV13 A134:DV03 A135:DA45 T701:PM02 T702:PM03 T704:PM04,T,2019-03-02T14:36:51.000,0.3341404769574161,"[85.97..86.43GHz,282.23kHz,7mJy/beam@10km/s,549.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.37..88.83GHz,282.23kHz,6.9mJy/beam@10km/s,550.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.77..98.23GHz,282.23kHz,6.6mJy/beam@10km/s,547.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.77..100.23GHz,282.23kHz,6.5mJy/beam@10km/s,548uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",88.59998875714251,848.0425055556389,"Hsieh, Pei-Ying",The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA.

This will enable the first measurements of density structure and molecular abundances on sub-parsec scales and build a unique legacy dataset for future study.",50_kms_c_a_07_7M,"Kauffmann, Jens; Schmiedeke, Anika; Battersby, Cara; Riquelme, Denise; Moser, Lydia; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Martin, Sergio; Requena Torres, Miguel Angel; Corby, Joanna; Higuchi, Aya; Pillai, Thushara; Ginsburg, Adam;",200.29576015013885,6.455661670622097,0.9100000262260437,uid://A001/X12a3/Xe8,uid://A001/X12a3/Xe9,uid://A002/Xd28a9e/X71b8,Sub-parsec Gas Excitation in the Galactic Center,S,TARGET,T,24.80236103626889,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2019-11-27T19:13:07.000,2.945666753447303,"[342.24..344.24GHz,1128.91kHz,157.8mJy/beam@10km/s,11.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [344.00..346.00GHz,1128.91kHz,152.3mJy/beam@10km/s,11.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [354.04..356.04GHz,1128.91kHz,178.5mJy/beam@10km/s,13.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [355.99..357.99GHz,1128.91kHz,200.3mJy/beam@10km/s,15.5mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",356.98786421840634,950.7587805309998,"Mills, Elisabeth",ALMACAL - VI.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"Shocked gas is often observed in the inner 400 pc of gas rich galactic nuclei. Our Galactic center provides a unique opportunity to study shocked gas in molecular clouds at sub-parsec scales. We propose to study a compact molecular cloud, M0.10-0.08, which has elevated emission in several 3 mm shock tracers (e.g., SiO, HCN) in single-dish observations (Mills & Battersby 2017). However, the source of the shocked emission is up for debate. M0.10-0.08 is located near two possible mechanisms for this shock activity: an interaction between an expanding bubble and a gas stream (Butterfield et al. 2018) or a gravitational tidal compression (Kruijssen et al. 2015).

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"Shocked gas is often observed in the inner 400 pc of gas rich galactic nuclei. Our Galactic center provides a unique opportunity to study shocked gas in molecular clouds at sub-parsec scales. We propose to study a compact molecular cloud, M0.10-0.08, which has elevated emission in several 3 mm shock tracers (e.g., SiO, HCN) in single-dish observations (Mills & Battersby 2017). However, the source of the shocked emission is up for debate. M0.10-0.08 is located near two possible mechanisms for this shock activity: an interaction between an expanding bubble and a gas stream (Butterfield et al. 2018) or a gravitational tidal compression (Kruijssen et al. 2015).

By understanding the mechanisms producing shocked gas in this cloud, we will be able to better understand observations of shocked gas in external galactic nuclei.",M0.10-0._a_03_TM2,"Ott, Juergen; Mills, Elisabeth; Lang, Cornelia; Battersby, Cara; Ginsburg, Adam;",2.1056929610565662,0.0850743888607145,4.1829681396484375,uid://A001/X133d/X29b2,uid://A001/X133d/X29b5,uid://A002/Xd95b2f/X22a1,M0.10-0.08: A Local Laboratory to Study Shocked Gas in Extreme Environments,S,TARGET,T,28.66653615964508,117187500.0,A001:DA44 A002:DA51 A003:DV12 A004:DV18 A006:DV25 A007:DV05 A009:DV22 A010:DV13 A011:DV21 A013:DA48 A015:DA64 A016:DV11 A017:DV14 A018:DA54 A019:DA61 A022:DV23 A023:DA42 A024:DA49 A025:DA46 A026:DV19 A028:DA63 A030:DA62 A031:DA59 A033:DA53 A034:DA50 A035:DA43 A036:DA45 A038:DV24 A039:DA56 A040:DA55 A041:DA57 A042:DV08 A043:DA60 A046:DA52 A047:DV15 A048:DV02 A049:DA47 A060:DV17 A062:DV10 A066:DV04 A068:DA65 A069:DV16 A072:DV20 A074:DV09,T,2020-07-06T00:41:33.000,2.857604871213404,"[86.27..86.38GHz,244.14kHz,2.2mJy/beam@10km/s,347.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.68..86.80GHz,244.14kHz,2.2mJy/beam@10km/s,347.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.77..86.89GHz,244.14kHz,2.2mJy/beam@10km/s,347.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.25..87.37GHz,244.14kHz,2.2mJy/beam@10km/s,347.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.79..87.91GHz,244.14kHz,2.2mJy/beam@10km/s,347.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.85..87.97GHz,244.14kHz,2.2mJy/beam@10km/s,347.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.56..88.67GHz,244.14kHz,2.1mJy/beam@10km/s,335.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [89.11..89.23GHz,244.14kHz,2.1mJy/beam@10km/s,335.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.22..99.34GHz,244.14kHz,2mJy/beam@10km/s,336.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.58..99.69GHz,244.14kHz,2mJy/beam@10km/s,336.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.94..100.18GHz,244.14kHz,2mJy/beam@10km/s,237.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.00..101.24GHz,244.14kHz,2mJy/beam@10km/s,237.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.40..101.52GHz,244.14kHz,2mJy/beam@10km/s,336.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.96..102.07GHz,244.14kHz,2mJy/beam@10km/s,336.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",89.17267273082615,717.7830222079864,"Butterfield, Natalie",ALMACAL - VI.

A massive dense clump precursor must be assembled and kept stable against fragmentation long enough to form massive stars, and a mechanism must be provided to trigger the formation of a top-heavy IMF cluster. The 100-pc ring of dense and cold clouds orbiting around the Galactic Center (Molinari et al. 2011) may offer both conditions: it hosts the best candidate for Arches-like precursor (Longmore et al. 2012), as well as the best example of a cloud-collision induced burst of star formation (Sgr B2). To test our hypothesis that the ring is the structure that channels material into high-mass prestellar clumps, we obtained Cycle 3 ALMA 12m-array priority ""A"" time to carry out a continuum and line survey of the denser clumps (Av > 50 mag) along the 100-pc ring. However, data analysis clearly indicates considerable signal levels from extended components beyond the spatial scale recoverable by the 12m-array.

G.","We report the discovery of the first <SUP>14</SUP>NH<SUB>3</SUB> (2,2) maser, seen in the Sgr B2 Main star-forming region near the center of the Milky Way, using data from the Very Large Array radio telescope. The maser is seen in both lower-resolution (3″ or ∼0.1 pc) data from 2012 and higher-resolution (0.″1 or ∼1000 au) data from 2018. In the higher-resolution data NH<SUB>3</SUB> (2,2) maser emission is detected toward five independent spots. The maser spots are not spatially or kinematically coincident with any other masers in this region, or with the peaks of the radio continuum emission from the numerous ultracompact and hypercompact H II regions in this area. While the (2,2) maser spots are spatially unresolved in our highest-resolution observations, they have unusually broad line widths of several kilometers per second, which suggests that each of these spots consists of multiple masers tracing unresolved velocity structure. No other NH<SUB>3</SUB> lines observed in Sgr B2 Main are seen to be masers, which continues to challenge existing models of NH<SUB>3</SUB> maser emission.",2018,"Sgr B2 is the densest region of star formation in the Galaxy, and it is therefore the most likely to form the most massive stars in the local universe. Such proto-very massive stars (proto-VMS) may accrete from significantly different structures than the ordered disks we are accustomed to observing around nearby low-mass stars.

The maser is seen in both lower-resolution (3″ or ∼0.1 pc) data from 2012 and higher-resolution (0.″1 or ∼1000 au) data from 2018. In the higher-resolution data NH<SUB>3</SUB> (2,2) maser emission is detected toward five independent spots. The maser spots are not spatially or kinematically coincident with any other masers in this region, or with the peaks of the radio continuum emission from the numerous ultracompact and hypercompact H II regions in this area. While the (2,2) maser spots are spatially unresolved in our highest-resolution observations, they have unusually broad line widths of several kilometers per second, which suggests that each of these spots consists of multiple masers tracing unresolved velocity structure.

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds. The observations requested here will constitute the most comprehensive survey of CMZ molecular clouds yet.

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies.

How the low-mass stars in clusters in the CMZ are formed has been unknown. In previous ALMA 1.3 mm contiuum data, we identified hundreds of faint compact sources at 2000 AU scales in three massive protoclusters in the CMZ. Assuming thermal dust emission, these sources may represent a large population of low-mass protostars that are expected from the canonical initial mass function. However, the alternative possibility that they are a mix of non-thermal and thermal free-free emission cannot be ruled out. Here we propose to use ALMA to map 3 mm lines and continuum emission, to obtain spatial distributions of dense gas and estimate spectral indices of the sources, in order to assess their nature. If the majority of the compact sources are associated with dense gas and are dust emission, this will be the first time we detect clutered low-mass star formation around the Galactic center, and will be a unique oppoturnity to examine if (low-mass) star formation in the extreme environments of the CMZ can be described by the canonical IMF.",the_20_k_a_03_TM2,"Zhang, Qizhou; Longmore, Steven; Kauffmann, Jens; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Kruijssen, Diederik; Pillai, Thushara; Battersby, Cara; Ginsburg, Adam;",1.5125384346881652,0.03351466026100216,0.7434027194976807,uid://A001/X1382/X2a,uid://A001/X1382/X2d,uid://A002/Xd5c881/X686d,Are they low-mass protostars?

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies.

How the low-mass stars in clusters in the CMZ are formed has been unknown. In previous ALMA 1.3 mm contiuum data, we identified hundreds of faint compact sources at 2000 AU scales in three massive protoclusters in the CMZ. Assuming thermal dust emission, these sources may represent a large population of low-mass protostars that are expected from the canonical initial mass function. However, the alternative possibility that they are a mix of non-thermal and thermal free-free emission cannot be ruled out. Here we propose to use ALMA to map 3 mm lines and continuum emission, to obtain spatial distributions of dense gas and estimate spectral indices of the sources, in order to assess their nature. If the majority of the compact sources are associated with dense gas and are dust emission, this will be the first time we detect clutered low-mass star formation around the Galactic center, and will be a unique oppoturnity to examine if (low-mass) star formation in the extreme environments of the CMZ can be described by the canonical IMF.",the_20_k_a_03_TM2,"Zhang, Qizhou; Longmore, Steven; Kauffmann, Jens; Liu, Hauyu Baobab; Mills, Elisabeth; Kruijssen, Diederik; Pillai, Thushara; Battersby, Cara; Ginsburg, Adam;",1.481676717245282,0.033514660375619156,0.7434027194976807,uid://A001/X1382/X2a,uid://A001/X1382/X2d,uid://A002/Xd5c881/X686d,Are they low-mass protostars?

In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2. We report the discovery of molecular gas streams orbiting around an invisible massive object in the central region of our Galaxy, based on the high-resolution molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The morphology and kinematics of these streams can be reproduced well through two Keplerian orbits around a single point mass of (3.2 ± 0.6) × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB>. We also found ionized gas toward the inner part of the orbiting gas, indicating dissociative shock and/or photoionization. Our results provide new circumstantial evidences for a wandering intermediate-mass black hole in the Galactic center, suggesting also that high-velocity compact clouds can be probes of quiescent black holes that abound in our Galaxy. We report the results of high-resolution molecular line observations of the high-velocity compact cloud HCN─0.085─0.094 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The HCN J = 4─3, HCO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 4─3, and CS J = 7─6 line images reveal that HCN─0.085─0.094 consists mainly of three small clumps with extremely broad velocity widths. Each of the three clumps has a 5.5 GHz radio continuum counterpart in its periphery toward Sgr A*. The positional relationship indicates that their surfaces have been ionized by ultraviolet photons from young stars in the central cluster, suggesting the clumps are in close proximity to the Galactic nucleus. One of the three clumps has a ring-like structure with a very steep velocity gradient. This kinematical structure suggests an orbit around a point-like object with a mass of ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>. The absence of stellar counterparts indicates that the point-like object may be a quiescent black hole.

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2. We report the discovery of molecular gas streams orbiting around an invisible massive object in the central region of our Galaxy, based on the high-resolution molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The morphology and kinematics of these streams can be reproduced well through two Keplerian orbits around a single point mass of (3.2 ± 0.6) × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB>. We also found ionized gas toward the inner part of the orbiting gas, indicating dissociative shock and/or photoionization. Our results provide new circumstantial evidences for a wandering intermediate-mass black hole in the Galactic center, suggesting also that high-velocity compact clouds can be probes of quiescent black holes that abound in our Galaxy. We report the results of high-resolution molecular line observations of the high-velocity compact cloud HCN─0.085─0.094 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The HCN J = 4─3, HCO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 4─3, and CS J = 7─6 line images reveal that HCN─0.085─0.094 consists mainly of three small clumps with extremely broad velocity widths. Each of the three clumps has a 5.5 GHz radio continuum counterpart in its periphery toward Sgr A*. The positional relationship indicates that their surfaces have been ionized by ultraviolet photons from young stars in the central cluster, suggesting the clumps are in close proximity to the Galactic nucleus. One of the three clumps has a ring-like structure with a very steep velocity gradient. This kinematical structure suggests an orbit around a point-like object with a mass of ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>. The absence of stellar counterparts indicates that the point-like object may be a quiescent black hole. This discovery adds another intermediate-mass black hole candidate in the central region of our Galaxy.",2019,"The central molecular zone of our Galaxy harbors a number of high-velocity compact clouds (HVCCs), which are a peculiar population of spatially compact (d < 10 pc) molecular clouds with extremely broad velocity widths (dV > 50 km/s). We have recently discovered two small (d ~1 pc) HVCCs (sHVCCs) in HCN J=4-3 and J=3-2 maps obtained with the JCMT. Both of these sHVCCs have similar physical properties, emanating from larger dense clouds in the position-velocity spaces. One has a faint counterpart in a Paschen-alpha image. In order to uncover the nature and the origin of these sHVCCs, we propose high-resolution observations in HCN J=4-3 and H26 alpha lines. The possible origin of the sHVCCs is (1) outflow from a deeply embedded massive protostar, (2) supernova explosion in the recent past, (3) cloud-cloud collision, or (4) high-velocity plunge of an invisible massive compact object into a molecular cloud. The ALMA images enable us to discriminate which process has formed the sHVCCs.

However, the source of the shocked emission is up for debate. M0.10-0.08 is located near two possible mechanisms for this shock activity: an interaction between an expanding bubble and a gas stream (Butterfield et al. 2018) or a gravitational tidal compression (Kruijssen et al. 2015). The low-resolution of the single-dish observations are unable to determine the morphological structure of the shocked gas. Our proposed ALMA observations will be able to determine the location and kinematics of the shocked emission and determine which mechanism is producing the shocked gas in this cloud.

M0.10-0.08 is located near two possible mechanisms for this shock activity: an interaction between an expanding bubble and a gas stream (Butterfield et al. 2018) or a gravitational tidal compression (Kruijssen et al. 2015). The low-resolution of the single-dish observations are unable to determine the morphological structure of the shocked gas. Our proposed ALMA observations will be able to determine the location and kinematics of the shocked emission and determine which mechanism is producing the shocked gas in this cloud. By understanding the mechanisms producing shocked gas in this cloud, we will be able to better understand observations of shocked gas in external galactic nuclei.",M0.10-0._a_03_TM1,"Ott, Juergen; Mills, Elisabeth; Lang, Cornelia; Battersby, Cara; Ginsburg, Adam;",1.163958317117268,0.04511233206086987,0.8540348410606384,uid://A001/X133d/X29b2,uid://A001/X133d/X29b3,uid://A002/Xd5c881/X84f8,M0.10-0.08: A Local Laboratory to Study Shocked Gas in Extreme Environments,S,TARGET,T,11.790447016287024,117187500.0,A001:DA44 A002:DA51 A007:DV05 A008:DV07 A011:DV21 A015:DA64 A016:DV11 A022:DV23 A023:DA42 A024:DA49 A027:DV06 A033:DA53 A035:DA43 A036:DA45 A042:DV08 A043:DA60 A044:DV03 A045:DV01 A047:DV15 A048:DV02 A058:DA41 A060:DV17 A062:DV10 A068:DA65 A069:DV16 A070:DA48 A072:DV20 A073:DA54 A074:DV09 A075:DV18 A076:DA59 A083:DV22 A085:DA63 A086:DV25 A087:DV14 A088:DV24 A089:DA57 A090:DA58 A091:DA56 A092:DV12 A093:DV19 A094:DA61 A105:DA50 A108:DA55 A111:DV13,T,2020-01-07T15:18:05.000,0.8291166452620368,"[86.27..86.38GHz,244.14kHz,1.2mJy/beam@10km/s,184.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.68..86.80GHz,244.14kHz,1.2mJy/beam@10km/s,184.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.77..86.89GHz,244.14kHz,1.2mJy/beam@10km/s,184.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.25..87.37GHz,244.14kHz,1.2mJy/beam@10km/s,184.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.79..87.91GHz,244.14kHz,1.2mJy/beam@10km/s,184.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.85..87.97GHz,244.14kHz,1.2mJy/beam@10km/s,184.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.56..88.67GHz,244.14kHz,1.2mJy/beam@10km/s,184.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [89.11..89.23GHz,244.14kHz,1.2mJy/beam@10km/s,184.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.22..99.34GHz,244.14kHz,1mJy/beam@10km/s,176.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.58..99.69GHz,244.14kHz,1mJy/beam@10km/s,176.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.94..100.18GHz,244.14kHz,1mJy/beam@10km/s,124.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.00..101.24GHz,244.14kHz,1mJy/beam@10km/s,124.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.40..101.52GHz,244.14kHz,1mJy/beam@10km/s,176.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.96..102.07GHz,244.14kHz,1mJy/beam@10km/s,176.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",88.6159397309766,717.8796196195489,"Butterfield, Natalie",ALMACAL - VI.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"Shocked gas is often observed in the inner 400 pc of gas rich galactic nuclei.

B.","The Additional Representative Images for Legacy (ARI-L) project is a European Development project for ALMA Upgrade approved by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), started in 2019 June. It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds.

It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use.

ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions.

Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation. Because both events were accompanied by maser flares, single-dish maser monitoring programs were reinvigorated. As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region, G358.931-0.030. Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst. Because this outburst has been caught in a much earlier stage, we have the best opportunity yet to explore and understand the underlying mechanism. Much like NGC6334I-MM1, the lack of a near-IR counterpart indicates a very deeply-embedded protostar.

A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"Shocked gas is often observed in the inner 400 pc of gas rich galactic nuclei. Our Galactic center provides a unique opportunity to study shocked gas in molecular clouds at sub-parsec scales. We propose to study a compact molecular cloud, M0.10-0.08, which has elevated emission in several 3 mm shock tracers (e.g., SiO, HCN) in single-dish observations (Mills & Battersby 2017). However, the source of the shocked emission is up for debate. M0.10-0.08 is located near two possible mechanisms for this shock activity: an interaction between an expanding bubble and a gas stream (Butterfield et al. 2018) or a gravitational tidal compression (Kruijssen et al. 2015). The low-resolution of the single-dish observations are unable to determine the morphological structure of the shocked gas. Our proposed ALMA observations will be able to determine the location and kinematics of the shocked emission and determine which mechanism is producing the shocked gas in this cloud.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"Shocked gas is often observed in the inner 400 pc of gas rich galactic nuclei. Our Galactic center provides a unique opportunity to study shocked gas in molecular clouds at sub-parsec scales. We propose to study a compact molecular cloud, M0.10-0.08, which has elevated emission in several 3 mm shock tracers (e.g., SiO, HCN) in single-dish observations (Mills & Battersby 2017). However, the source of the shocked emission is up for debate. M0.10-0.08 is located near two possible mechanisms for this shock activity: an interaction between an expanding bubble and a gas stream (Butterfield et al. 2018) or a gravitational tidal compression (Kruijssen et al. 2015). The low-resolution of the single-dish observations are unable to determine the morphological structure of the shocked gas. Our proposed ALMA observations will be able to determine the location and kinematics of the shocked emission and determine which mechanism is producing the shocked gas in this cloud. By understanding the mechanisms producing shocked gas in this cloud, we will be able to better understand observations of shocked gas in external galactic nuclei.",M0.10-0._a_03_7M,"Ott, Juergen; Mills, Elisabeth; Lang, Cornelia; Battersby, Cara; Ginsburg, Adam;",13.338828658004859,0.5418734141639183,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X133d/X29b2,uid://A001/X133d/X29b7,uid://A002/Xd77a17/Xcc9,M0.10-0.08: A Local Laboratory to Study Shocked Gas in Extreme Environments,S,TARGET,T,76.84473287020113,125000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J504:CM12 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2020-01-18T01:04:05.000,11.286919148500617,"[86.26..86.39GHz,244.14kHz,14.3mJy/beam@10km/s,2.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.68..86.80GHz,244.14kHz,13.9mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.77..86.89GHz,244.14kHz,13.8mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.25..87.37GHz,244.14kHz,13.5mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.79..87.91GHz,244.14kHz,13.2mJy/beam@10km/s,2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.85..87.97GHz,244.14kHz,13.2mJy/beam@10km/s,2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.55..88.68GHz,244.14kHz,13.5mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [89.11..89.24GHz,244.14kHz,13.3mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.22..99.34GHz,244.14kHz,13.2mJy/beam@10km/s,2.1mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.57..99.70GHz,244.14kHz,13.3mJy/beam@10km/s,2.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.93..100.18GHz,244.14kHz,13.8mJy/beam@10km/s,1.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.00..101.25GHz,244.14kHz,14.3mJy/beam@10km/s,1.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.40..101.52GHz,244.14kHz,14.4mJy/beam@10km/s,2.4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [101.95..102.08GHz,244.14kHz,14.1mJy/beam@10km/s,2.3mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",89.17301910774736,717.8688518901583,"Butterfield, Natalie",ALMACAL - VI.

It aims to increase the legacy value of the ALMA Science Archive (ASA) by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to that of data from more recent Cycles processed for imaging with the ALMA Pipeline. As of mid-2021, more than 150,000 images have been returned to the ASA for public use. At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions. This will help to refine star formation theory, but it also informs our understanding of starbursts and the centers of galaxies. Our Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS) just used the SMA to observe, for the first time, all major CMZ clouds at interferometer resolution. This gives a first --- but limited --- overview of the properties of dense substructure in CMZ clouds. In a pilot study of the cloud G0.253+0.016 (the ""Brick"") we have now shown that ALMA teaches important additional lessons about the density structure (from dust continuum), temperature structure (from H2CO), kinematics (from SiO tracing shocks), and the densest and coldest gas (from DCN) of the clouds. These data provide extensive constraints on the structure, state, and formation of CMZ clouds. The observations requested here will constitute the most comprehensive survey of CMZ molecular clouds yet.

At its completion in 2022, the project will have provided enhanced products for at least 70% of the observational data from Cycles 2-4 processable with the ALMA Pipeline. In this paper, we present the project rationale, its implementation, and the new opportunities offered to ASA users by the ARI-L products. The ARI-L cubes and images complement the much-limited number of archival image products generated during the data quality assurance stages (QA2), which cover only a small fraction of the available data for those Cycles. ARI-L imaging products are highly relevant for many science cases and significantly enhance the possibilities for exploiting archival data. Indeed, ARI-L products facilitate archive access and data usage for science purposes even for non-expert data miners, provide a homogeneous view of all data for better data set comparisons and download selections, make the archive more accessible to visualization and analysis tools, and enable the generation of preview images and plots similar to those possible for subsequent Cycles.",2021,"Studies of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way allow exploration of star formation under extreme conditions.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"ALMA is the only instrument to revolutionize our understanding of the early evolution of high-mass protostars, which is one of the main open issues in today's astrophysics. In our Cycle 2 project, SPARKS, we targeted a homogenous sample of 35 objects from the most massive infrared-quiet clumps selected from the ATLASGAL survey. SPARKS has been very successful reaching its science goals: we discovered the highest mass young protostars with envelope masses up to 130 AU within 2000 AU scales, and revealed excellent candidates of high-mass prestellar cores. At the same time, SPARKS revealed very intriguing fragmentation properties: single high-mass protostars with very high core formation efficiency versus typically low-mass protostars forming clusters. It is clear that now we need to understand the origin of these extrem routes of fragmentiation, and to search for more examples of these extreme fragmentation are crucial. Since the number of the most massive infrared quiet clumps in the inner Galaxy is limited, the only possible way to search for them, is to complete and extend the sample of all infrared quiet massive clumps up to 4.5 kpc from ATLASGAL.",G008.670_a_07_7M,"Longmore, Steven; Bronfman, Leonardo; Wyrowski, Friedrich; Urquhart, James; Tan, Jonathan; Menten, Karl; Duarte Cabral, Ana; Traficante, Alessio; Henning, Thomas; Chapillon, Edwige; Beuther, Henrik; Palau, Aina; Commercon, Benoit; Peretto, Nicolas; Testi, Leonardo; Motte, Frederique; Fuller, Gary; Leurini, Silvia; Bontemps, Sylvain; Schuller, Frederic;",25.478664346843562,0.899899832573877,0.9100000262260437,uid://A001/X12a2/X238,uid://A001/X12a2/X23b,uid://A002/Xd21a3a/X1110,"Extending SPARKS: Exploring the origin of single high-mass protostars, and rich clusters",S,TARGET,T,25.45100183237481,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04 N606:CM06,T,2020-06-24T00:00:00.000,3.341861685415567,"[333.32..335.31GHz,1128.91kHz,25.6mJy/beam@10km/s,1.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [335.19..337.19GHz,1128.91kHz,22.3mJy/beam@10km/s,1.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [345.23..347.23GHz,1128.91kHz,22.7mJy/beam@10km/s,1.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [347.07..349.07GHz,1128.91kHz,25.5mJy/beam@10km/s,1.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",348.065599994134,975.2013082754978,"Csengeri, Timea",ALMACAL - VI.

The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF). This is largely due to the lack of clear--cut examples of dense clumps that are bound to form stars but have not done so yet (high--mass starless clumps: HMSCs). While scattered, small sky patch searches have been made, no systematic galaxy wide survey that can place such searches on a statistical firm footing has ever been conducted. We have now performed a systematic search for HMSCs from the ATLASGAL 870mu survey that covers the entire inner Galactic plane which are dense and devoid of infrared sources up to 70mum.

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF).

We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>.

The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

G. S.","Context. The ionization feedback from H II regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a typical size of 0.1-1 pc), such as dust temperature and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of H II regions modifies the core-scale (~0.025 pc) fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by H II regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Methods: Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, with a typical angular resolution of 1.3′′, we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by H II regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted candidate HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. We carried out a comparison between the two types of candidate HMSCs. We used multi-wavelength data to analyze the interaction between H II regions and the impacted candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Results: A total of 51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted candidate HMSCs, even though H II regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores. Both types of candidate HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP> and 0.3λ<SUB>J,clump</SUB><SUP>th</SUP>. The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted candidate HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on the capacities of H II regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in candidate HMSCs. <BR /> Conclusions: The fragmentation at ~0.025 pc scale for both types of candidate HMSCs is likely to be thermal-dominant, meanwhile H II regions probably have the capacity to assist in the formation of dense structures in the impacted candidate HMSCs. Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

Future ALMA imaging surveys covering a large number of impacted candidate HMSCs with high turbulence levels are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF). This is largely due to the lack of clear--cut examples of dense clumps that are bound to form stars but have not done so yet (high--mass starless clumps: HMSCs). While scattered, small sky patch searches have been made, no systematic galaxy wide survey that can place such searches on a statistical firm footing has ever been conducted. We have now performed a systematic search for HMSCs from the ATLASGAL 870mu survey that covers the entire inner Galactic plane which are dense and devoid of infrared sources up to 70mum. Embedded star formation will manifest via outflowing, shocked, and warm gas component with little or no evidence of cold gas towards dense cores. By weeding out such masqueraders, and revealing the extent of fragmentation in all HMSCs, a feat only achievable with a survey machine like ALMA in an ambitious but highly economical <10 hrs main array time, we will for the first time reveal the truly massive starless cores. We will obtain the most robust constraints to date on whether massive starless cores exists, their lifetime and the initial conditions for HMSF.",AGAL354._a_06_TP,"Zhang, Qizhou; Mardones, Diego; Wyrowski, Friedrich; Kauffmann, Jens; Gomez, Laura; Urquhart, James; Giannetti, Andrea; Wang, Ke; Guzman-Fernandez, Andres; Leurini, Silvia; Menten, Karl;",57.202138898689824,1.710777488718715,0.4235568046569824,uid://A001/X885/X2f6,uid://A001/X885/X2fd,uid://A002/Xda845c/X4be9,Galactic Census of All Massive Starless Cores within 5 kpc,S,TARGET,T,414.14697787360006,2000000000.0,A108:PM04 A121:PM03 A126:PM01 A135:PM02 T701:PM02 T702:PM03 T703:PM01 T704:PM04,F,2021-07-27T00:00:00.000,23.364290998539225,"[215.96..217.96GHz,488.28kHz,57mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [217.83..219.83GHz,488.28kHz,57.2mJy/beam@10km/s,3.5mJy/beam@native, XX] U [230.19..232.19GHz,488.28kHz,54.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX] U [231.96..233.96GHz,488.28kHz,54.8mJy/beam@10km/s,3.4mJy/beam@native, XX]",218.83087947048676,630.98107560143,"Pillai, Thushara",H II regions and high-mass starless clump candidates.

Michail, Joseph M.; Wardle, Mark; Yusef-Zadeh, Farhad; Kunneriath, Devaky","We present and analyze ALMA submillimeter observations from a multiwavelength campaign of Sgr A* during 2019 July 18. In addition to the submillimeter, we utilize concurrent mid-infrared (mid-IR; Spitzer) and X-ray (Chandra) observations. The submillimeter emission lags less than δ t ≍ 30 minutes behind the mid-IR data. However, the entire submillimeter flare was not observed, raising the possibility that the time delay is a consequence of incomplete sampling of the light curve. The decay of the submillimeter emission is not consistent with synchrotron cooling. Therefore, we analyze these data adopting an adiabatically expanding synchrotron source that is initially optically thick or thin in the submillimeter, yielding time-delayed or synchronous flaring with the IR, respectively. The time-delayed model is consistent with a plasma blob of radius 0.8 R <SUB>S</SUB> (Schwarzschild radius), electron power-law index p = 3.5 (N(E) ∝ E <SUP>-p </SUP>), equipartition magnetic field of B <SUB>eq</SUB> ≍ 90 Gauss, and expansion velocity ${v}_{\exp }\approx 0.004c$ . The simultaneous emission is fit by a plasma blob of radius 2 R <SUB>S</SUB>, p = 2.5, B <SUB>eq</SUB> ≍ 27 Gauss, and ${v}_{\exp }\approx 0.014c$ . Since the submillimeter time delay is not completely unambiguous, we cannot definitively conclude which model better represents the data. This observation presents the best evidence for a unified flaring mechanism between submillimeter and X-ray wavelengths and places significant constraints on the source size and magnetic field strength. We show that concurrent observations at lower frequencies would be able to determine if the flaring emission is initially optically thick or thin in the submillimeter. We report a timing analysis of near-infrared (NIR), X-ray, and submillimeter data during a 3 day coordinated campaign observing Sagittarius A*. Data were collected at 4.5 μm with the Spitzer Space Telescope, 2-8 keV with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, 3-70 keV with NuSTAR, 340 GHz with ALMA, and 2.2 μm with the GRAVITY instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Two dates show moderate variability with no significant lags between the submillimeter and the infrared at 99% confidence. A moderately bright NIR flare (F <SUB>K</SUB> ~ 15 mJy) was captured on July 18 simultaneous with an X-ray flare (F <SUB>2-10 keV</SUB> ~ 0.1 counts s<SUP>-1</SUP>) that most likely preceded bright submillimeter flux (F <SUB>340 GHz</SUB> ~ 5.5 Jy) by about $+{34}_{-33}^{+14}$ minutes at 99% confidence. The uncertainty in this lag is dominated by the fact that we did not observe the peak of the submillimeter emission. A synchrotron source cooled through adiabatic expansion can describe a rise in the submillimeter once the synchrotron self-Compton NIR and X-ray peaks have faded. This model predicts high GHz and THz fluxes at the time of the NIR/X-ray peak and electron densities well above those implied from average accretion rates for Sgr A*. However, the higher electron density postulated in this scenario would be in agreement with the idea that 2019 was an extraordinary epoch with a heightened accretion rate. Since the NIR and X-ray peaks can also be fit by a nonthermal synchrotron source with lower electron densities, we cannot rule out an unrelated chance coincidence of this bright submillimeter flare with the NIR/X-ray emission.",2021,ALMA observatory program aiming at monitoring the submm flux of Sgr A* in coordination with space observatories.

The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts.

We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF.

The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_d_06_TM1,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",0.4716765092688353,0.016630269940493252,0.9266798496246338,uid://A001/X133d/X1319,uid://A001/X133d/X131a,uid://A002/Xde8105/X1f7b,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,TARGET,T,0.33378409773811074,1875000000.0,A058:DA41 A074:DV09 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A094:DV14 A101:DA65 A105:DA64 A108:PM04 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:PM03 A122:DA44 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A131:DV21 A132:DA57 A133:DV10 A134:DA63 A135:PM02 P403:DA45 P408:DV17 P409:DV11 P410:DV06 P411:DA56 P412:DA60 P413:DV03 S303:DV23 S305:DA62 S306:DV20 S307:DA47 S308:DV22 W201:DA50 W202:DA55 W205:DA52 W207:DV25 W208:DV13 W209:DV05,F,2020-11-19T17:00:22.000,0.017806249828509892,"[251.61..253.49GHz,1128.91kHz,540.7uJy/beam@10km/s,36.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [253.95..255.82GHz,1128.91kHz,479.1uJy/beam@10km/s,32.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [265.56..267.43GHz,1128.91kHz,471.7uJy/beam@10km/s,32.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [267.81..269.68GHz,1128.91kHz,470.3uJy/beam@10km/s,32.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",266.49646280402084,1263.7150670093233,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","Binary interactions dominate the evolution of massive stars, but their role is less clear for low- and intermediate-mass stars. The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak.

From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope.

The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars.

M.","Using the JVLA, we explored the Galactic center (GC) with a resolution of 0.″05 at 33.0 and 44.6 GHz. We detected 64 hypercompact radio sources (HCRs) in the central parsec. The dense group of HCRs can be divided into three spectral types: 38 steep-spectrum (α ≤ -0.5) sources, 10 flat-spectrum (-0.5 &lt; α ≤ 0.2) sources, and 17 inverted-spectrum sources having α &gt; 0.2, assuming S ∝ ν <SUP> α </SUP>. The steep-spectrum HCRs are likely to represent a population of massive stellar remnants associated with nonthermal compact radio sources powered by neutron stars and stellar black holes. The surface-density distribution of the HCRs as a function of radial distance (R) from Sgr A* can be described as a steep power law Σ(R) ∝ R <SUP>-Γ</SUP>, with Γ = 1.6 ± 0.2, along with the presence of a localized order-of-magnitude enhancement in the range 0.1-0.3 pc. The steeper profile of the HCRs relative to that of the central cluster might result from the concentration of massive stellar remnants by mass segregation at the GC. The GC magnetar SGR J1745-2900 belongs to the inverted-spectrum subsample. We find two spectral components present in the averaged radio spectrum of SGR J1745-2900, separated at ν ~ 30 GHz. The centimeter component is fitted to a power law with α <SUB>cm</SUB> = -1.5 ± 0.6. The enhanced millimeter component shows a rising spectrum α <SUB>mm</SUB> = 1.1 ± 0.2. Based on the ALMA observations at 225 GHz, we find that the GC magnetar is highly variable on a day-to-day timescale, showing variations up to a factor of 6. Further JVLA and ALMA observations of the variability, spectrum, and polarization of the HCRs are critical for determining whether they are associated with stellar remnants.",2022,"Sagittarius A*, the variable radio/IR/X-ray source associated with the supermassive black hole at the center of the Galaxy, has recently (April-May 2019) displayed unusual episodes of activity in the infrared and at 230 GHz. An unprecedentedly bright intensity excursion was observed at 2.2 µm with the Keck Observatory, well outside of the range of the 13,000 previous independent integrations with Keck, VLT and Spitzer. Other Keck observations in April and May have also shown episodes of unusually high fluxes, leading us to consider whether the source has entered a new, higher state of activity, or whether its accretion rate has risen. In either case, it is important to learn whether it is evolving and how long it will last, presuming that it is lasting longer than the April-May time frame. We therefore propose to observe SgrA* with ALMA at 345 GHz -- the peak of the SgrA* SED -- on 4 occasions separated by a month between July 21 and October 19. The first of these would be of considerably enhanced scientific value because it would correspond with simultaneous observations by Chandra, Spitzer, and NuStar.",Sagittar_a_07_TM1,"Witzel, Gunther; Turner, Jean; Ghez, Andrea; Do, Tuan;",4.5029371456218845,0.1831594550930618,1.3722825050354004,uid://A001/X13d6/X11b,uid://A001/X13d6/X11c,uid://A002/Xdf1f69/X1107,Is Sagittarius A* in a New State?,S,CHECK WVR,F,0.790565573949744,1875000000.0,A027:DV17 A042:DV05 A058:DA41 A073:DV23 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A086:DV22 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A091:DA61 A093:DV03 A094:DV14 A096:DA50 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A105:DA64 A108:PM04 A110:DA55 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A120:DV19 A121:PM03 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A131:DV21 A133:DV10 A134:DA63 A135:PM02 P401:DA59 P403:DA45 P410:DV06 S301:DA54 S306:DV20 S307:DA47 W207:DV25,F,2020-02-29T20:14:09.000,0.0313896971559635,"[316.01..317.89GHz,1128.91kHz,6.3mJy/beam@10km/s,475.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [317.89..319.77GHz,1128.91kHz,4.5mJy/beam@10km/s,342uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [328.06..329.94GHz,1128.91kHz,4.5mJy/beam@10km/s,344.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [329.94..331.82GHz,1128.91kHz,4.5mJy/beam@10km/s,345uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",328.998128022916,1025.7613302475843,"Morris, Mark",Detection of a Dense Group of Hypercompact Radio Sources in the Central Parsec of the Galaxy,"Zhao, Jun-Hui",T,2022ApJ...927L...6Z,Galactic centres/nuclei,Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,C18O (3-2)

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*.

Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation. Because both events were accompanied by maser flares, single-dish maser monitoring programs were reinvigorated. As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region, G358.931-0.030. Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst. Because this outburst has been caught in a much earlier stage, we have the best opportunity yet to explore and understand the underlying mechanism. Much like NGC6334I-MM1, the lack of a near-IR counterpart indicates a very deeply-embedded protostar.

N.","We present (sub)millimeter imaging at 0.″5 resolution of the massive star-forming region G358.93−0.03 acquired in multiple epochs at 2 and 3 months following the recent flaring of its 6.7 GHz CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser emission. Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation. Because both events were accompanied by maser flares, single-dish maser monitoring programs were reinvigorated. As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region, G358.931-0.030. Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst. Because this outburst has been caught in a much earlier stage, we have the best opportunity yet to explore and understand the underlying mechanism. Much like NGC6334I-MM1, the lack of a near-IR counterpart indicates a very deeply-embedded protostar.

Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation.

As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region, G358.931-0.030. Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst. Because this outburst has been caught in a much earlier stage, we have the best opportunity yet to explore and understand the underlying mechanism.

N.","We present (sub)millimeter imaging at 0.″5 resolution of the massive star-forming region G358.93−0.03 acquired in multiple epochs at 2 and 3 months following the recent flaring of its 6.7 GHz CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser emission. Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation.

The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.",2019,"The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) around the Galactic center is a unique star forming environment with extreme physical conditions.

In previous ALMA 1.3 mm contiuum data, we identified hundreds of faint compact sources at 2000 AU scales in three massive protoclusters in the CMZ. Assuming thermal dust emission, these sources may represent a large population of low-mass protostars that are expected from the canonical initial mass function. However, the alternative possibility that they are a mix of non-thermal and thermal free-free emission cannot be ruled out.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae.

The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*.

M.","Using the JVLA, we explored the Galactic center (GC) with a resolution of 0.″05 at 33.0 and 44.6 GHz. We detected 64 hypercompact radio sources (HCRs) in the central parsec. The dense group of HCRs can be divided into three spectral types: 38 steep-spectrum (α ≤ -0.5) sources, 10 flat-spectrum (-0.5 &lt; α ≤ 0.2) sources, and 17 inverted-spectrum sources having α &gt; 0.2, assuming S ∝ ν <SUP> α </SUP>. The steep-spectrum HCRs are likely to represent a population of massive stellar remnants associated with nonthermal compact radio sources powered by neutron stars and stellar black holes. The surface-density distribution of the HCRs as a function of radial distance (R) from Sgr A* can be described as a steep power law Σ(R) ∝ R <SUP>-Γ</SUP>, with Γ = 1.6 ± 0.2, along with the presence of a localized order-of-magnitude enhancement in the range 0.1-0.3 pc.

These new observations reveal the presence of a ring-like molecular structure surrounding the star. Morphology and kinematics of the gas are consistent with a slowly expanding torus located near the equatorial plane of AG Car. Using non-LTE line modelling, we derived the physical parameters of the gas, which is warm (∼50 K) and moderately dense (∼10<SUP>3</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). The total mass of molecular gas in the ring is 2.7 ± 0.9 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. We analysed the radio continuum map, which depicts a point-like source surrounded by a shallow nebula. From the flux of the point-like source, we derived a current mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = (1.55\pm 0.21)\times 10^{-5}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Finally, to better understand the complex circumstellar environment of AG Car, we put the newly detected ring in relation to the main nebula of dust and ionized gas. We discuss possible formation scenarios for the ring, namely, the accumulation of interstellar material due to the action of the stellar wind, the remnant of a close binary interaction or merger, and an equatorially enhanced mass-loss episode. If molecular gas formed in situ as a result of a mass eruption, it would account for at least a $30{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the total mass ejected by AG Car. This detection adds a new piece to the puzzle of the complex mass-loss history of AG Car, providing new clues about the interplay between LBV stars and their surroundings.",2021,"Massive stars play a fundamental role in the evolution of galaxies. they are among the major contributors to the interstellar UV radiation and provide processed material and mechanical energy to the ISM via their strong winds.Evolutionary models fail to reproduce the transition between their O and WR phases, mostly because of the poor knowledge of the amount of mass lost during the transition. recent work on three LBVs has shown that a so far neglected component of molecular gas is present around these stars. On the basis, of the three previous detections and our APEX data, we propose to observe 9 Galactic LBVs with the ACA in the 12CO and 13CO J=2-1 lines.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","Binary interactions dominate the evolution of massive stars, but their role is less clear for low- and intermediate-mass stars. The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains. The outflows of evolved stars are the best laboratories to answer this pivotal question due to their rich chemistry and relatively simple dynamical structure. With this Large Program we aim to establish the dominant physical and chemical processes in the winds of oxygen-rich evolved stars over a range of stellar masses, pulsation behaviours, mass-loss rates, and evolutionary phases. The goal is to unravel the phase transition from gas-phase to dust species, pinpoint the chemical pathways, map the morphological structure, and study the interplay between dynamical and chemical phenomena. The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_d_06_TM2,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",0.6972072514235446,0.02455420866514829,0.6664448380470276,uid://A001/X133d/X1319,uid://A001/X133d/X131c,uid://A002/Xd58951/X7342,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,TARGET,T,3.4847657881625578,1875000000.0,A001:DA44 A007:DV05 A008:DV07 A011:DV21 A015:DA64 A016:DV11 A022:DV23 A023:DA42 A024:DA49 A027:DV06 A033:DA53 A042:DV08 A043:DA60 A044:DV03 A045:DV01 A047:DV15 A058:DA41 A060:DV17 A062:DV10 A068:DA65 A069:DV16 A070:DA48 A072:DV20 A073:DA54 A074:DV09 A075:DV18 A076:DA59 A083:DV22 A085:DA63 A086:DV25 A087:DV14 A089:DA57 A090:DA58 A091:DA56 A092:DV12 A093:DV19 A094:DA61 A096:DA46 A101:DA51 A104:DV02 A105:DA50 A108:DA55 A111:DV13 A134:DA45 A135:DA62,F,2019-12-03T13:21:37.000,0.23427147921457542,"[251.61..253.49GHz,1128.91kHz,794.9uJy/beam@10km/s,53.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [253.95..255.82GHz,1128.91kHz,708.2uJy/beam@10km/s,47.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [265.56..267.43GHz,1128.91kHz,697.2uJy/beam@10km/s,48uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [267.81..269.68GHz,1128.91kHz,695.2uJy/beam@10km/s,48.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",266.49645316076123,1263.7399507780397,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","Binary interactions dominate the evolution of massive stars, but their role is less clear for low- and intermediate-mass stars. The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains. The outflows of evolved stars are the best laboratories to answer this pivotal question due to their rich chemistry and relatively simple dynamical structure. With this Large Program we aim to establish the dominant physical and chemical processes in the winds of oxygen-rich evolved stars over a range of stellar masses, pulsation behaviours, mass-loss rates, and evolutionary phases. The goal is to unravel the phase transition from gas-phase to dust species, pinpoint the chemical pathways, map the morphological structure, and study the interplay between dynamical and chemical phenomena. The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_d_06_TM2,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",2.464998208238977,0.08681226285298316,0.6664448380470276,uid://A001/X133d/X1319,uid://A001/X133d/X131c,uid://A002/Xd58951/X7342,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,CHECK WVR,F,3.4417936679329886,1875000000.0,A001:DA44 A007:DV05 A008:DV07 A011:DV21 A015:DA64 A016:DV11 A022:DV23 A023:DA42 A024:DA49 A027:DV06 A033:DA53 A042:DV08 A043:DA60 A044:DV03 A045:DV01 A047:DV15 A058:DA41 A060:DV17 A062:DV10 A068:DA65 A069:DV16 A070:DA48 A072:DV20 A073:DA54 A074:DV09 A075:DV18 A076:DA59 A083:DV22 A085:DA63 A086:DV25 A087:DV14 A089:DA57 A090:DA58 A091:DA56 A092:DV12 A093:DV19 A094:DA61 A096:DA46 A101:DA51 A104:DV02 A105:DA50 A108:DA55 A111:DV13 A134:DA45 A135:DA62,F,2019-12-03T13:21:37.000,0.23181376511113255,"[251.62..253.49GHz,1128.91kHz,2.8mJy/beam@10km/s,188.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [253.95..255.82GHz,1128.91kHz,2.5mJy/beam@10km/s,168.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [265.56..267.43GHz,1128.91kHz,2.5mJy/beam@10km/s,169.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [267.81..269.68GHz,1128.91kHz,2.5mJy/beam@10km/s,170uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",266.496977549288,1263.7399507780397,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","Binary interactions dominate the evolution of massive stars, but their role is less clear for low- and intermediate-mass stars. The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains. The outflows of evolved stars are the best laboratories to answer this pivotal question due to their rich chemistry and relatively simple dynamical structure. With this Large Program we aim to establish the dominant physical and chemical processes in the winds of oxygen-rich evolved stars over a range of stellar masses, pulsation behaviours, mass-loss rates, and evolutionary phases. The goal is to unravel the phase transition from gas-phase to dust species, pinpoint the chemical pathways, map the morphological structure, and study the interplay between dynamical and chemical phenomena.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","Binary interactions dominate the evolution of massive stars, but their role is less clear for low- and intermediate-mass stars. The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains. The outflows of evolved stars are the best laboratories to answer this pivotal question due to their rich chemistry and relatively simple dynamical structure. With this Large Program we aim to establish the dominant physical and chemical processes in the winds of oxygen-rich evolved stars over a range of stellar masses, pulsation behaviours, mass-loss rates, and evolutionary phases. The goal is to unravel the phase transition from gas-phase to dust species, pinpoint the chemical pathways, map the morphological structure, and study the interplay between dynamical and chemical phenomena. The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_b_06_TM2,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",2.4715019312556716,0.08344086062107507,0.7112305164337158,uid://A001/X133d/X130d,uid://A001/X133d/X1310,uid://A002/Xe0be64/X5f1,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,CHECK WVR,F,1.6720686848064914,1875000000.0,A007:DV21 A015:DV25 A027:DV17 A042:DV05 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA59 A072:DA53 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A086:DV22 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A093:DV03 A094:DV14 A096:DA50 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A110:DA55 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:DV10 A122:DA44 A123:DA48 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A132:DA57 A134:DA63,F,2020-12-19T15:05:49.000,0.09830789475744772,"[220.26..222.13GHz,1128.91kHz,2.5mJy/beam@10km/s,155uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [223.65..225.53GHz,1128.91kHz,2.5mJy/beam@10km/s,155.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [235.46..237.33GHz,1128.91kHz,2.4mJy/beam@10km/s,156.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [239.18..240.12GHz,564.45kHz,2.4mJy/beam@10km/s,225.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",221.19740013796778,707.5406261173696,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains. The outflows of evolved stars are the best laboratories to answer this pivotal question due to their rich chemistry and relatively simple dynamical structure. With this Large Program we aim to establish the dominant physical and chemical processes in the winds of oxygen-rich evolved stars over a range of stellar masses, pulsation behaviours, mass-loss rates, and evolutionary phases. The goal is to unravel the phase transition from gas-phase to dust species, pinpoint the chemical pathways, map the morphological structure, and study the interplay between dynamical and chemical phenomena. The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_b_06_TM2,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",0.823834467238924,0.027813615345340853,0.7112305164337158,uid://A001/X133d/X130d,uid://A001/X133d/X1310,uid://A002/Xe0be64/X5f1,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,TARGET,T,1.666886091280557,1875000000.0,A007:DV21 A015:DV25 A027:DV17 A042:DV05 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA59 A072:DA53 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A086:DV22 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A093:DV03 A094:DV14 A096:DA50 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A110:DA55 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:DV10 A122:DA44 A123:DA48 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A132:DA57 A134:DA63,F,2020-12-19T15:05:49.000,0.09822115848110134,"[220.26..222.13GHz,1128.91kHz,823.8uJy/beam@10km/s,51.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [223.65..225.53GHz,1128.91kHz,818.9uJy/beam@10km/s,51.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [235.46..237.33GHz,1128.91kHz,803uJy/beam@10km/s,52.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [239.18..240.12GHz,564.45kHz,815.6uJy/beam@10km/s,75.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",221.1970648727749,707.5406261173696,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","Binary interactions dominate the evolution of massive stars, but their role is less clear for low- and intermediate-mass stars. The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains. The outflows of evolved stars are the best laboratories to answer this pivotal question due to their rich chemistry and relatively simple dynamical structure. With this Large Program we aim to establish the dominant physical and chemical processes in the winds of oxygen-rich evolved stars over a range of stellar masses, pulsation behaviours, mass-loss rates, and evolutionary phases. The goal is to unravel the phase transition from gas-phase to dust species, pinpoint the chemical pathways, map the morphological structure, and study the interplay between dynamical and chemical phenomena. The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_c_06_TM2,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",1.2807136897724116,0.04997608616652697,2.415836811065674,uid://A001/X133d/X1313,uid://A001/X133d/X1316,uid://A002/Xe07f3e/Xfff2,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,TARGET,T,2.23359806866612,1875000000.0,A007:DV21 A015:DV25 A022:DV01 A027:DV17 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA59 A072:DA53 A073:DV23 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A086:DV22 A087:DV18 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A093:DV03 A094:DV14 A096:DA50 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A110:DA55 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:DV10 A122:DA44 A123:DA48 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A132:DA57 A134:DA63 A135:PM02,F,2020-12-31T13:42:11.000,0.10771631697857263,"[244.08..245.01GHz,564.45kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,120.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.38..247.25GHz,1128.91kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,85.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [258.65..260.52GHz,1128.91kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,87uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [262.13..263.07GHz,564.45kHz,1.3mJy/beam@10km/s,126.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",259.5843641347238,645.5937074948245,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","Binary interactions dominate the evolution of massive stars, but their role is less clear for low- and intermediate-mass stars. The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains. The outflows of evolved stars are the best laboratories to answer this pivotal question due to their rich chemistry and relatively simple dynamical structure. With this Large Program we aim to establish the dominant physical and chemical processes in the winds of oxygen-rich evolved stars over a range of stellar masses, pulsation behaviours, mass-loss rates, and evolutionary phases. The goal is to unravel the phase transition from gas-phase to dust species, pinpoint the chemical pathways, map the morphological structure, and study the interplay between dynamical and chemical phenomena. The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_c_06_TM2,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",4.049970101057877,0.15803829500897398,2.415836811065674,uid://A001/X133d/X1313,uid://A001/X133d/X1316,uid://A002/Xe07f3e/Xfff2,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,CHECK WVR,F,2.158253813476982,1875000000.0,A007:DV21 A015:DV25 A022:DV01 A027:DV17 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA59 A072:DA53 A073:DV23 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A086:DV22 A087:DV18 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A093:DV03 A094:DV14 A096:DA50 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A110:DA55 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:DV10 A122:DA44 A123:DA48 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A132:DA57 A134:DA63 A135:PM02,F,2020-12-31T13:42:11.000,0.10845757848104101,"[244.08..245.01GHz,564.45kHz,4.1mJy/beam@10km/s,381.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.38..247.25GHz,1128.91kHz,4.1mJy/beam@10km/s,270uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [258.65..260.52GHz,1128.91kHz,4mJy/beam@10km/s,275.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [262.13..263.07GHz,564.45kHz,4.1mJy/beam@10km/s,400.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",259.58476275501334,645.5937074948245,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

V838 Mon erupted in 2002, quickly becoming the prototype of a new type of stellar eruption known today as the (luminous) red nova. Red nova outbursts are thought to be caused by stellar mergers. The merger in V838 Mon took place in a triple or higher system involving two B-type stars. <BR /> Aims: We wish to characterize the merger remnant ~17 yr after the eruption to learn more about the remaining system, the progenitor, and the merger physics. <BR /> Methods: We mapped the merger site with ALMA at a resolution of ~25 mas, or 148 au for a distance of 5.9 kpc, in continuum dust emission and in rotational lines of simple molecules, including CO, SiO, SO, SO<SUB>2</SUB>, AlOH, and H<SUB>2</SUB>S. We use radiative transfer calculations to reproduce the architecture of the remnant at the epoch of the ALMA observations. We also make use of optical spectroscopy data obtained mainly with VLT/X-shooter and SALT/HRS. <BR /> Results: For the first time, we identify the position of the B-type companion relative to the outbursting component of V838 Mon. The stellar remnant is surrounded by a clumpy wind with characteristics similar to those of the winds of red supergiants. The merger product is also associated with an elongated structure of 17.6 × 7.6 mas (104 × 45 au) seen in continuum emission, and which we interpret as a disk seen at a moderate inclination. Maps of continuum and molecular emission also show a complex region of interaction between the B-type star (its gravity, radiation, and wind) and the flow of matter ejected in 2002. The remnant's molecular mass is about 0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and the dust mass is 8.3 × 10<SUP>−3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The mass of the atomic component remains unconstrained. <BR /> Conclusions: The most interesting region for understanding the merger of V838 Mon lies in its direct vicinity and appears elongated, but details of its substructure remain unknown. To study it further and in more detail will require even higher angular resolutions. ALMA maps show us an extreme form of interaction between the merger ejecta and the distant (~250 au) companion. This interaction is similar to that known from the Anteres AB system but at a much higher mass loss rate. The B-type star not only deflects the merger ejecta but also changes its molecular composition with an involvement of circumstellar shocks. The ALMA view of V838 Mon offers the best images of a merger site so far. <P />Movies associated with Figs. 9 and 12 are available at <A href=""https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202141526/olm"">https://www.aanda.org</A> We present multiepoch observations with the Very Long Baseline Array of SiO maser emission in the v = 1, J = 1-0 transition at 43 GHz from the remnant of the red nova V838 Mon. We modeled the positions of maser spots to derive a parallax of 0.166 ± 0.060 mas. Combining this parallax with other distance information results in a distance of 5.6 ± 0.5 kpc, which is in agreement with an independent geometric distance of 6.1 ± 0.6 kpc from modeling polarimetry images of V838 Mon's light echo. Combining these results, and including a weakly constraining Gaia parallax, yields a best estimate of distance of 5.9 ± 0.4 kpc. The maser spots are located close to the peaks of continuum at ∼225 GHz and SiO J = 5-4 thermal emission detected with the Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array. The proper motion of V838 Mon confirms its membership in a small open cluster in the Outer spiral arm of the Milky Way. <P />Fits images associated with Figs. 2-4 are only available at CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (<A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://130.79.128.5</A>) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/638/A17"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/638/A17</A>",2020,"Red novae erupt in stellar collisions which we can observe in real time.

We propose to use ALMA to spatially resolve molecular emission in two red nova remnants, V1309 Sco and V838 Mon, and reproduce their 3-dimensional spatio-kinematic structure.

Ortiz-León, Gisela N.; Menten, Karl M.; Kamiński, Tomasz; Brunthaler, Andreas; Reid, Mark J.; Tylenda, Romuald","Context. V838 Mon erupted in 2002, quickly becoming the prototype of a new type of stellar eruption known today as the (luminous) red nova. Red nova outbursts are thought to be caused by stellar mergers. The merger in V838 Mon took place in a triple or higher system involving two B-type stars. <BR /> Aims: We wish to characterize the merger remnant ~17 yr after the eruption to learn more about the remaining system, the progenitor, and the merger physics. <BR /> Methods: We mapped the merger site with ALMA at a resolution of ~25 mas, or 148 au for a distance of 5.9 kpc, in continuum dust emission and in rotational lines of simple molecules, including CO, SiO, SO, SO<SUB>2</SUB>, AlOH, and H<SUB>2</SUB>S. We use radiative transfer calculations to reproduce the architecture of the remnant at the epoch of the ALMA observations. We also make use of optical spectroscopy data obtained mainly with VLT/X-shooter and SALT/HRS. <BR /> Results: For the first time, we identify the position of the B-type companion relative to the outbursting component of V838 Mon. The stellar remnant is surrounded by a clumpy wind with characteristics similar to those of the winds of red supergiants. The merger product is also associated with an elongated structure of 17.6 × 7.6 mas (104 × 45 au) seen in continuum emission, and which we interpret as a disk seen at a moderate inclination. Maps of continuum and molecular emission also show a complex region of interaction between the B-type star (its gravity, radiation, and wind) and the flow of matter ejected in 2002. The remnant's molecular mass is about 0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and the dust mass is 8.3 × 10<SUP>−3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The mass of the atomic component remains unconstrained. <BR /> Conclusions: The most interesting region for understanding the merger of V838 Mon lies in its direct vicinity and appears elongated, but details of its substructure remain unknown. To study it further and in more detail will require even higher angular resolutions. ALMA maps show us an extreme form of interaction between the merger ejecta and the distant (~250 au) companion. This interaction is similar to that known from the Anteres AB system but at a much higher mass loss rate. The B-type star not only deflects the merger ejecta but also changes its molecular composition with an involvement of circumstellar shocks. The ALMA view of V838 Mon offers the best images of a merger site so far. <P />Movies associated with Figs. 9 and 12 are available at <A href=""https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202141526/olm"">https://www.aanda.org</A> We present multiepoch observations with the Very Long Baseline Array of SiO maser emission in the v = 1, J = 1-0 transition at 43 GHz from the remnant of the red nova V838 Mon. We modeled the positions of maser spots to derive a parallax of 0.166 ± 0.060 mas. Combining this parallax with other distance information results in a distance of 5.6 ± 0.5 kpc, which is in agreement with an independent geometric distance of 6.1 ± 0.6 kpc from modeling polarimetry images of V838 Mon's light echo. Combining these results, and including a weakly constraining Gaia parallax, yields a best estimate of distance of 5.9 ± 0.4 kpc. The maser spots are located close to the peaks of continuum at ∼225 GHz and SiO J = 5-4 thermal emission detected with the Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array. The proper motion of V838 Mon confirms its membership in a small open cluster in the Outer spiral arm of the Milky Way. <P />Fits images associated with Figs. 2-4 are only available at CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (<A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://130.79.128.5</A>) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/638/A17"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/638/A17</A>",2020,"Red novae erupt in stellar collisions which we can observe in real time.

N.","We present (sub)millimeter imaging at 0.″5 resolution of the massive star-forming region G358.93−0.03 acquired in multiple epochs at 2 and 3 months following the recent flaring of its 6.7 GHz CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser emission. Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation. Because both events were accompanied by maser flares, single-dish maser monitoring programs were reinvigorated. As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region, G358.931-0.030. Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst. Because this outburst has been caught in a much earlier stage, we have the best opportunity yet to explore and understand the underlying mechanism. Much like NGC6334I-MM1, the lack of a near-IR counterpart indicates a very deeply-embedded protostar. ALMA DDT observations are now critical to provide a clear picture of star formation in this protocluster by pinpointing the outbursting protostar with respect to the masers before they fade, and placing their kinematics into context of the dust and thermal gas structures that trace protostellar accretion and outflow.",G358.93_c_06_TM1,"Hirano, Naomi; Cyganowski, Claudia; MacLeod, Gordon; Sugiyama, Koichiro; Hunter, Todd; Chibueze, James; Menten, Karl; Stecklum, Bringfried; Sobolev, Andrey; Burns, Ross;",0.4331916790929893,0.038226734729195265,0.9151495695114136,uid://A001/X13c4/X1da,uid://A001/X13c4/X1db,uid://A002/Xdd7b18/X68be,"Exploring the dust, thermal gas, and new methanol masers in the third massive protostellar outburst: G358.931-0.030",T,TARGET,T,0.3756782908267536,117187500.0,A074:DV09 A094:DV14 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A108:PM04 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:PM03 A122:DA44 A123:DA48 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A131:DV21 A132:DA57 A133:DV10 A134:DA63 A135:PM02 A136:DV04 P401:DA59 P403:DA45 P409:DV11 P410:DV06 P411:DA56 P412:DA60 P413:DV03 S301:DA54 S303:DV23 S305:DA62 S306:DV20 S307:DA47 S308:DV22 S309:DA51 W201:DA50 W202:DA55 W203:DV16 W205:DA52 W207:DV25 W208:DV13 W209:DV05 W210:DA53,F,2019-12-17T16:02:06.000,0.022259359478237657,"[215.26..215.37GHz,122.07kHz,434.6uJy/beam@10km/s,107.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [215.55..215.67GHz,122.07kHz,434.4uJy/beam@10km/s,107.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [217.06..217.18GHz,122.07kHz,433.2uJy/beam@10km/s,107.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [217.25..217.37GHz,122.07kHz,433uJy/beam@10km/s,107.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [229.48..229.72GHz,122.07kHz,423.8uJy/beam@10km/s,76.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [233.81..234.05GHz,122.07kHz,421.8uJy/beam@10km/s,77uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.11660326743305,156.5107776835811,"Brogan, Crystal",A Multitransition Methanol Maser Study of the Accretion Burst Source G358.93-0.03-MM1 Sub-arcsecond (Sub)millimeter Imaging of the Massive Protocluster G358.93−0.03: Discovery of 14 New Methanol Maser Lines Associated with a Hot Core,"Bayandina, O.

N.","We present (sub)millimeter imaging at 0.″5 resolution of the massive star-forming region G358.93−0.03 acquired in multiple epochs at 2 and 3 months following the recent flaring of its 6.7 GHz CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser emission. Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation. Because both events were accompanied by maser flares, single-dish maser monitoring programs were reinvigorated. As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region, G358.931-0.030. Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst. Because this outburst has been caught in a much earlier stage, we have the best opportunity yet to explore and understand the underlying mechanism. Much like NGC6334I-MM1, the lack of a near-IR counterpart indicates a very deeply-embedded protostar. ALMA DDT observations are now critical to provide a clear picture of star formation in this protocluster by pinpointing the outbursting protostar with respect to the masers before they fade, and placing their kinematics into context of the dust and thermal gas structures that trace protostellar accretion and outflow.",G358.93_c_06_TM1,"Hirano, Naomi; Cyganowski, Claudia; MacLeod, Gordon; Sugiyama, Koichiro; Hunter, Todd; Chibueze, James; Menten, Karl; Stecklum, Bringfried; Sobolev, Andrey; Burns, Ross;",1.9292058572691568,0.17024128490495066,0.9151495695114136,uid://A001/X13c4/X1da,uid://A001/X13c4/X1db,uid://A002/Xdd7b18/X68be,"Exploring the dust, thermal gas, and new methanol masers in the third massive protostellar outburst: G358.931-0.030",T,CHECK WVR,F,0.3648694433234819,117187500.0,A074:DV09 A094:DV14 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A108:PM04 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:PM03 A122:DA44 A123:DA48 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A131:DV21 A132:DA57 A133:DV10 A134:DA63 A135:PM02 A136:DV04 P401:DA59 P403:DA45 P409:DV11 P410:DV06 P411:DA56 P412:DA60 P413:DV03 S301:DA54 S303:DV23 S305:DA62 S306:DV20 S307:DA47 S308:DV22 S309:DA51 W201:DA50 W202:DA55 W203:DV16 W205:DA52 W207:DV25 W208:DV13 W209:DV05 W210:DA53,F,2019-12-17T16:02:06.000,0.021838554386030336,"[215.25..215.37GHz,122.07kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,479.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [215.55..215.67GHz,122.07kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,479.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [217.06..217.17GHz,122.07kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,479.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [217.25..217.37GHz,122.07kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,479.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [229.48..229.72GHz,122.07kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,341.2uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [233.81..234.05GHz,122.07kHz,1.9mJy/beam@10km/s,342.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",217.11583362230039,156.5107776835811,"Brogan, Crystal",A Multitransition Methanol Maser Study of the Accretion Burst Source G358.93-0.03-MM1 Sub-arcsecond (Sub)millimeter Imaging of the Massive Protocluster G358.93−0.03: Discovery of 14 New Methanol Maser Lines Associated with a Hot Core,"Bayandina, O.

In addition to the submillimeter, we utilize concurrent mid-infrared (mid-IR; Spitzer) and X-ray (Chandra) observations. The submillimeter emission lags less than δ t ≍ 30 minutes behind the mid-IR data. However, the entire submillimeter flare was not observed, raising the possibility that the time delay is a consequence of incomplete sampling of the light curve. The decay of the submillimeter emission is not consistent with synchrotron cooling. Therefore, we analyze these data adopting an adiabatically expanding synchrotron source that is initially optically thick or thin in the submillimeter, yielding time-delayed or synchronous flaring with the IR, respectively. The time-delayed model is consistent with a plasma blob of radius 0.8 R <SUB>S</SUB> (Schwarzschild radius), electron power-law index p = 3.5 (N(E) ∝ E <SUP>-p </SUP>), equipartition magnetic field of B <SUB>eq</SUB> ≍ 90 Gauss, and expansion velocity ${v}_{\exp }\approx 0.004c$ . The simultaneous emission is fit by a plasma blob of radius 2 R <SUB>S</SUB>, p = 2.5, B <SUB>eq</SUB> ≍ 27 Gauss, and ${v}_{\exp }\approx 0.014c$ . Since the submillimeter time delay is not completely unambiguous, we cannot definitively conclude which model better represents the data. This observation presents the best evidence for a unified flaring mechanism between submillimeter and X-ray wavelengths and places significant constraints on the source size and magnetic field strength. We show that concurrent observations at lower frequencies would be able to determine if the flaring emission is initially optically thick or thin in the submillimeter. We report a timing analysis of near-infrared (NIR), X-ray, and submillimeter data during a 3 day coordinated campaign observing Sagittarius A*. Data were collected at 4.5 μm with the Spitzer Space Telescope, 2-8 keV with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, 3-70 keV with NuSTAR, 340 GHz with ALMA, and 2.2 μm with the GRAVITY instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Two dates show moderate variability with no significant lags between the submillimeter and the infrared at 99% confidence. A moderately bright NIR flare (F <SUB>K</SUB> ~ 15 mJy) was captured on July 18 simultaneous with an X-ray flare (F <SUB>2-10 keV</SUB> ~ 0.1 counts s<SUP>-1</SUP>) that most likely preceded bright submillimeter flux (F <SUB>340 GHz</SUB> ~ 5.5 Jy) by about $+{34}_{-33}^{+14}$ minutes at 99% confidence. The uncertainty in this lag is dominated by the fact that we did not observe the peak of the submillimeter emission. A synchrotron source cooled through adiabatic expansion can describe a rise in the submillimeter once the synchrotron self-Compton NIR and X-ray peaks have faded. This model predicts high GHz and THz fluxes at the time of the NIR/X-ray peak and electron densities well above those implied from average accretion rates for Sgr A*. However, the higher electron density postulated in this scenario would be in agreement with the idea that 2019 was an extraordinary epoch with a heightened accretion rate. Since the NIR and X-ray peaks can also be fit by a nonthermal synchrotron source with lower electron densities, we cannot rule out an unrelated chance coincidence of this bright submillimeter flare with the NIR/X-ray emission.",2021,ALMA observatory program aiming at monitoring the submm flux of Sgr A* in coordination with space observatories.

The dense group of HCRs can be divided into three spectral types: 38 steep-spectrum (α ≤ -0.5) sources, 10 flat-spectrum (-0.5 &lt; α ≤ 0.2) sources, and 17 inverted-spectrum sources having α &gt; 0.2, assuming S ∝ ν <SUP> α </SUP>. The steep-spectrum HCRs are likely to represent a population of massive stellar remnants associated with nonthermal compact radio sources powered by neutron stars and stellar black holes. The surface-density distribution of the HCRs as a function of radial distance (R) from Sgr A* can be described as a steep power law Σ(R) ∝ R <SUP>-Γ</SUP>, with Γ = 1.6 ± 0.2, along with the presence of a localized order-of-magnitude enhancement in the range 0.1-0.3 pc. The steeper profile of the HCRs relative to that of the central cluster might result from the concentration of massive stellar remnants by mass segregation at the GC. The GC magnetar SGR J1745-2900 belongs to the inverted-spectrum subsample. We find two spectral components present in the averaged radio spectrum of SGR J1745-2900, separated at ν ~ 30 GHz. The centimeter component is fitted to a power law with α <SUB>cm</SUB> = -1.5 ± 0.6. The enhanced millimeter component shows a rising spectrum α <SUB>mm</SUB> = 1.1 ± 0.2. Based on the ALMA observations at 225 GHz, we find that the GC magnetar is highly variable on a day-to-day timescale, showing variations up to a factor of 6. Further JVLA and ALMA observations of the variability, spectrum, and polarization of the HCRs are critical for determining whether they are associated with stellar remnants.",2022,"Sagittarius A*, the variable radio/IR/X-ray source associated with the supermassive black hole at the center of the Galaxy, has recently (April-May 2019) displayed unusual episodes of activity in the infrared and at 230 GHz. An unprecedentedly bright intensity excursion was observed at 2.2 µm with the Keck Observatory, well outside of the range of the 13,000 previous independent integrations with Keck, VLT and Spitzer. Other Keck observations in April and May have also shown episodes of unusually high fluxes, leading us to consider whether the source has entered a new, higher state of activity, or whether its accretion rate has risen. In either case, it is important to learn whether it is evolving and how long it will last, presuming that it is lasting longer than the April-May time frame. We therefore propose to observe SgrA* with ALMA at 345 GHz -- the peak of the SgrA* SED -- on 4 occasions separated by a month between July 21 and October 19.

In our early analysis, we find that the magnetic field might be dynamically important to stabilize these filaments even though they are below the tidal threshold. We also find that the dense cores traced by the HC3N line are located within these filamentary structures. As indicated by the 20"" JCMT-SCUPOL data and the negative strips in our existing 12 m-array maps, we propose the ACA observation to recover the pc-scale structures to combine with our 12 m-array data in order to investigate the kinematic connection between the dense cores and the filaments, as well as the influence of the magnetic field.

Mark; Hamanowicz, Aleksandra; Biggs, Andrew D.; Dutta, Rajeshwari","Binary interactions dominate the evolution of massive stars, but their role is less clear for low- and intermediate-mass stars. The evolution of a spherical wind from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star into a nonspherical planetary nebula (PN) could be due to binary interactions. We observed a sample of AGB stars with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and found that their winds exhibit distinct nonspherical geometries with morphological similarities to planetary nebulae (PNe). We infer that the same physics shapes both AGB winds and PNe; additionally, the morphology and AGB mass-loss rate are correlated. These characteristics can be explained by binary interaction. We propose an evolutionary scenario for AGB morphologies that is consistent with observed phenomena in AGB stars and PNe. Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results. <BR /> Methods: We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species. <BR /> Results: AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0''.2 to 0''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, of 1.7 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for Al<SUP>35</SUP>Cl, 7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> for Al<SUP>37</SUP>Cl, and 1 × 10<SUP>−7</SUP> for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> and ≤10<SUP>−8</SUP>, relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>, for HCl and HF, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen inthe wind. ...(4)",2019,"Over 200 molecules and 15 dust species have been detected in the ISM, stellar winds, exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei etc. One of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics deals with the phase transition from simple molecules to larger gas-phase clusters and eventually dust grains.

The legacy will be (1) the plethora of ground-breaking results in the field of evolved stars, astrochemistry, and the chemical life cycle of the ISM; and (2) a foundation to better understand astrochemical processes in a range of research fields, from proto-planetary disks to luminous infrared galaxies.",KW_Sgr_c_06_TM1,"Sahai, Raghvendra; Waters, Laurens; Price, Daniel; Plane, John; De Beck, Elvire; Richards, Anita; de Koter, Alex; Wong, Ka Tat; Menten, Karl; Keller, Denise; Homan, Ward; Kervella, Pierre; Yates, Jeremy; Lee, Kin Long Kelvin; Baudry, Alain; Gobrecht, David; Van de Sande, Marie; Lagadec, Eric; Montarges, Miguel; Müller, Holger; Khouri, Theo; Maercker, Matthias; Danilovich, Taissa;",0.9358414979959667,0.03675142154947248,1.8631935119628906,uid://A001/X133d/X1313,uid://A001/X133d/X1314,uid://A002/Xde9c3e/X82f2,ATOMIUM: ALMA Tracing the Origins of Molecules In dUst-forming oxygen-rich M-type stars,L,PHASE WVR,F,0.5297929303068762,1875000000.0,A058:DA41 A074:DV09 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A089:DV16 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A094:DV14 A096:DA50 A101:DA65 A104:DA43 A105:DA64 A108:PM04 A111:DV12 A115:DA46 A116:DV08 A118:DV07 A120:DV19 A121:PM03 A122:DA44 A124:DA42 A125:DA49 A126:PM01 A127:DV24 A128:DV15 A129:DV01 A130:DA58 A131:DV21 A133:DV10 A134:DA63 A135:PM02 P403:DA45 P409:DV11 P410:DV06 P411:DA56 S303:DV23 S305:DA62 S306:DV20 S307:DA47 S308:DV22 W202:DA55 W205:DA52 W207:DV25 W208:DV13 W210:DA53,F,2020-10-30T09:45:23.000,0.024424807283475968,"[244.08..245.01GHz,564.45kHz,982.5uJy/beam@10km/s,91.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.37..247.24GHz,1128.91kHz,953.7uJy/beam@10km/s,63.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [258.67..260.55GHz,1128.91kHz,935.8uJy/beam@10km/s,63.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [262.13..263.07GHz,564.45kHz,932.1uJy/beam@10km/s,90.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",259.6106995977997,645.5564167588947,"Decin, Leen",(Sub)stellar companions shape the winds of evolved stars ALMACAL - VI.

These gas streams are on eccentric orbits that pass by the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential well at Sgr A*. Initial investigation suggests that pericenter passage by Sgr A* may induce tidally-driven compression of clouds and subsequent star formation further downstream. This new mode of cloud collapse could give us an absolute timeline for star formation, with t= 0 occurring at pericenter passage on the streams, a fourth dimension for studies of star formation. We propose to obtain maps of the most structured cloud approaching pericenter.

These gas streams are on eccentric orbits that pass by the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential well at Sgr A*. Initial investigation suggests that pericenter passage by Sgr A* may induce tidally-driven compression of clouds and subsequent star formation further downstream. This new mode of cloud collapse could give us an absolute timeline for star formation, with t= 0 occurring at pericenter passage on the streams, a fourth dimension for studies of star formation. We propose to obtain maps of the most structured cloud approaching pericenter. We outline three testable predictions of the tidally-driven cloud collapse scenario, which precludes current active star formation in the cloud.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars.

The three SiO (5-4) clumps closest to Sgr A* show the largest central velocities, ~150 km s–1, and the broadest asymmetric line widths with full width zero intensity (FWZI) ~110-147 km s–1. The remaining clumps, distributed mainly to the NE of the ionized mini-spiral, have narrow FWZI (~18-56 km s–1). Using CARMA SiO (2-1) data, Large Velocity Gradient modeling of the SiO line ratios for the broad velocity clumps constrains the column density N(SiO) ~1014 cm–2, and the H2 gas density n_H_2=(3{--}9)\times 10^5 cm–3 for an assumed kinetic temperature 100-200 K. The SiO clumps are interpreted as highly embedded protostellar outflows, signifying an early stage of massive star formation near Sgr A* in the last 104-105 yr. Support for this interpretation is provided by the SiO (5-4) line luminosities and velocity widths which lie in the range measured for protostellar outflows in star-forming regions in the Galaxy. Furthermore, spectral energy distribution modeling of stellar sources shows two young stellar object candidates near SiO clumps, supporting in situ star formation near Sgr A*. We discuss the nature of star formation where the gravitational potential of the black hole dominates. In particular, we suggest that external radiative pressure exerted on self-shielded molecular clouds enhances the gas density, before the gas cloud becomes gravitationally unstable near Sgr A*. Alternatively, collisions between clumps in the ring may trigger gravitational collapse. We present radio and infrared observations indicating ongoing star formation activity inside the ∼2–5 pc circumnuclear ring at the Galactic center. Collectively these measurements suggest a continued disk-based mode of ongoing star formation has taken place near Sgr A* over the last few million years. First, Very Large Array observations with spatial resolution 2.″17 × 0.″81 reveal 13 water masers, several of which have multiple velocity components. The presence of interstellar water masers suggests gas densities that are sufficient for self-gravity to overcome the tidal shear of the 4× {10}6 {M}ȯ black hole. Second, spectral energy distribution modeling of stellar sources indicates massive young stellar object (YSO) candidates interior to the molecular ring, supporting in situ star formation near Sgr A* and appear to show a distribution similar to that of the counter-rotating disks of ∼100 OB stars orbiting Sgr A*. Some YSO candidates (e.g., IRS 5) have bow shock structures, suggesting that they have gaseous disks that are phototoevaporated and photoionized by the strong radiation field. Third, we detect clumps of SiO (2-1) and (5-4) line emission in the ring based on Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy and Sub-Millimeter Array observations. The FWHM and luminosity of the SiO emission is consistent with shocked protostellar outflows. Fourth, two linear ionized features with an extent of ∼0.8 pc show blue and redshifted velocities between +50 and ‑40 km s‑1, suggesting protostellar jet driven outflows with mass-loss rates of ∼ 5× {10}-5 {M}ȯ yr‑1.

As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region G358.93-0.03. Since then, the global maser community has discovered 20 new torsionally-excited methanol maser transitions from 6 to 360 GHz toward this source(!), all likely powered by an ongoing accretion outburst in a massive protostar. SMA and ALMA DDT observations have pinpointed the deeply-embedded outbursting object, which powers a line-rich hot core and lacks a near-IR counterpart, much like NGC6334I-MM1. Measuring the lifetime of the excited masers and the rate of decline of the heated dust continuum is now critical to compare to the first two cases, which we will achieve by repeating the 400 au resolution DDT observations in Band 5 and 7. We also propose new Band 6 and 7 observations designed to disentangle the multiple outflows present in the host protocluster, and assess the energetics, and hence dynamical impact of massive protostellar episodic accretion.",G358.93_b_07_TM2,"Hirano, Naomi; MacLeod, Gordon; Chen, Xi; Chibueze, James; Menten, Karl; Sobolev, Andrey; Cyganowski, Claudia; Sugiyama, Koichiro; McGuire, Brett; Hunter, Todd; Stecklum, Bringfried; Burns, Ross;",1.0383149404936989,0.03839699922117366,1.4941831827163696,uid://A001/X1465/X2492,uid://A001/X1465/X2495,uid://A002/Xe220f2/X1690,Tracking the lifetime and resolving the properties of the massive protostellar accretion outburst in G358.93-0.03,S,TARGET,T,4.3632369715477255,1875000000.0,A001:DA48 A002:DA44 A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A015:DV25 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A024:DA58 A033:DA49 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A036:DA64 A040:DA65 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A047:DV06 A048:DA50 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA59 A072:DA53 A073:DV23 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A086:DV22 A087:DV18 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A091:DA61 A092:DV04 A093:DV03 A094:DV14 T703:PM01,F,2021-02-19T19:34:05.000,0.3340244367736589,"[290.51..292.39GHz,976.56kHz,1.1mJy/beam@10km/s,75.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [292.49..294.37GHz,976.56kHz,1mJy/beam@10km/s,75.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [302.62..304.49GHz,976.56kHz,1mJy/beam@10km/s,76.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [304.14..306.01GHz,976.56kHz,1.1mJy/beam@10km/s,79.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",303.5559035659949,962.6614265944254,"Brogan, Crystal",,,T,,"Outflows, jets and ionized winds, High-mass star formation",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (7-6)

CO-0.4 is a newly-discovered candidate site of an on-going CCC event; ALMA observations have revealed two distinct velocity components bridged by broad emissions of SiO 5-4 line, which is a classical signpost of CCC. We have also discovered a few bright peaks of DCN or COM species in the midst of the fast turbulence in the CCC interface; preliminary analysis shows that several of them may have very high density (10^7 cm-3), relatively narrow velocity width (2 km/s), and possibly a low virial parameter of 1-10. For cycle-7, we propose a follow-up observation to measure accurate values of their masses, virial parameters, and volume density distribution on the basis of excitation analysis with multi-transition CS, SiO, and HCN lines. If these peaks are confirmed to be self-gravitating cores that are capable of star-formation, we may be able to firstly capture the onset of CCC-triggered star-formation in the Galactic central region.",CO-0.40-_a_06_TM1,"Nagai, Makoto; Kamegai, Kazuhisa;",1.465118807005251,0.0738773246873651,1.0935388803482056,uid://A001/X1465/X17c,uid://A001/X1465/X17d,uid://A002/Xe48598/X10fcb,Search for Self-Gravitating Cores in the Cloud-Cloud Collision Region CO-0.4,S,TARGET,T,11.28074072749406,468750000.0,A002:DA44 A003:DV23 A004:DA56 A005:DV22 A006:DV13 A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A013:DV11 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A019:DA61 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A025:DV10 A026:DV18 A027:DV17 A028:DA59 A030:DA52 A031:DA62 A033:DA49 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A036:DA64 A038:DA60 A039:DV16 A040:DA65 A041:DV03 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A046:DA51 A047:DV06 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A072:DA53,T,2021-07-22T08:55:15.000,1.0841476795432534,"[244.75..245.22GHz,282.23kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,194.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.61..247.49GHz,1128.91kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,96.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [258.83..259.30GHz,282.23kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,199.3uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [260.34..260.80GHz,282.23kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,199.5uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",260.57018366712225,324.9961232910867,"Tanaka, Kunihiko",,,T,,Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (6-5)

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars.

Although the existence of vinyl cyanide (C2H3CN) on Titan was previously inferred using Cassini mass spectrometry, a definitive detection has been lacking until now. We report the first spectroscopic detection of vinyl cyanide in Titan's atmosphere, obtained using archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), collected from February to May 2014. We detect the three strongest rotational lines of C2H3CN in the frequency range of 230 to 232 GHz, each with >4σ confidence. Radiative transfer modeling suggests that most of the C2H3CN emission originates at altitudes of ≥200 km, in agreement with recent photochemical models. The vertical column densities implied by our best-fitting models lie in the range of 3.7 × 10^13 to 1.4 × 10^14 cm-2. The corresponding production rate of vinyl cyanide and its saturation mole fraction imply the availability of sufficient dissolved material to form ~10^7 cell membranes/cm3 in Titan's sea Ligeia Mare. We have exploited ALMA calibration observations to carry out a novel, wide, and deep submillimeter (submm) survey, almacal. These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of ˜25 μJy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on ≥5σ detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S 1.2 mm ≥ 0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 μm and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2×. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs—representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies—in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution. ...(1)",2015,"Sgr A* in the Galactic Center is by now the best constrained supermassive black hole candidate. Its radio spectrum peaks at submm-waves and its size as measured with VLBI experiments shrinks with increasing frequency, exhibiting a clear size-frequency relation. The millimeter-wave emission comes from less than four Schwarzschild radii (R_S) and will allow imaging of the event horizon with mmVLBI in the future. The predicted close encounter of the G2 gas cloud in mid-2013 will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study accretion processes on scales from a few thousand to a few R_S and explore the accretion-jet coupling that may take place in Sgr A*. First discovered through NIR astrometric imaging, G2 contains at least 3 M_Earth of dusty, ionized gas that is undergoing tidal disruption and will reach periastron of 3100 R_S. The millimeter flux density will rise as gas reaches a few R_S, which could be as short as the free fall time of a few months or as long as the viscous time of years to decades. Increased accretion rates could lead to an order of magnitude increase in the flux density, which will be indicative of a new accretion-jet state that can be imaged with VLBI. The G2 encounter represents a low mass, large impact parameter analog to stellar tidal disruption events, which have recently been show to produce coupled accretion and outflow events. We request 10 epochs of band 6 and 7 flux monitoring to search for evidence of increased accretion onto Sgr A*. This proposal is part of a multi-wavelength campaign to study the G2 encounter; we have approved multi-epoch Chandra X-ray time to observe Sgr A* in 2013. Finally, the integrated data set coupled with our Cycle 0 data will provide the best-ever multi-frequency map of the gas streamers (Sgr A West) in the Galactic Center and probe for new compact structures.",Jan_SgrA_352-216_12m_C32-any Jul_SgrA_352-216_12m_C32-any Jun_SgrA_352-216_12m_C32-any NovDec_SgrA_352-216_12m_C32-any OctNov...,"Fragile, Patrick; Baganoff, Frederick; Maitra, Dipankar; Schaaf, Reinhold; Utomo, Dyas; Moscibrodzka, Monika; Falcke, Heino; Brunthaler, Andreas; Menten, Karl; Brinkerink, Christiaan; Markoff, Sera; Marrone, Dan; Barkats, Denis; Dexter, Jason; Impellizzeri, Violette; Peck, Alison; Gammie, Charles; Rushton, Anthony; wright, melvyn;",3.1116119807108036,0.05512346987967766,1.148868441581726,uid://A002/X5d7935/X2fa,uid://A002/X5d7935/X2fb,uid://A002/X65007d/X76a,The G2 Gas Cloud Encounter with Sagittarius A*: Accretion Structure on Scales of 3000 to 1 Schwarzschild Radii,S,TARGET WVR,T,8.7363787939487,1875000000.0,A001:DA64 A002:DV03 A003:DV12 A004:DV04 A005:DV19 A007:DV23 A010:DV12 A011:DV22 A014:DV01 A015:DV21 A016:DA62 A017:DA51 A020:DV20 A021:DV08 A023:DV08 A024:DV13 A025:DV14 A026:DA47 A028:DA45 A031:DV11 A034:DV20 A035:DA52 A037:DV06 A038:DA53 A038:DV24 A040:DA46 A042:DV15 A043:DA64 A046:DA48 A050:DA42 A054:DA55 A060:DV09 A063:DA54 A064:DA56 A066:DA43 A067:DA46 A068:DA44 A070:DA45 A071:DV10 A072:DV13 A074:DV15 A075:DA43 A076:DA57 A077:DV02 A079:DA41 A080:DV18 A081:DV01 A082:DV05 A087:DA58 A088:DV24 A096:DV07 A106:DV25 A117:DV19 A131:DV24 A137:DV03 A138:DV17 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N605:CM04 N606:CM06 T701:PM03 T702:DA62 ,F,2020-10-22T00:00:00.000,0.1681511034805175,"[215.01..217.00GHz,31250.00kHz,2.4mJy/beam@10km/s,141.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [217.01..219.00GHz,31250.00kHz,2.4mJy/beam@10km/s,142uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [230.96..232.84GHz,976.56kHz,2.3mJy/beam@10km/s,147.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [232.78..234.77GHz,31250.00kHz,2.3mJy/beam@10km/s,143.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [338.61..340.59GHz,31250.00kHz,2mJy/beam@10km/s,152.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [340.61..342.59GHz,31250.00kHz,2.1mJy/beam@10km/s,161.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [350.73..352.72GHz,31250.00kHz,2.1mJy/beam@10km/s,163uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [352.66..354.54GHz,976.56kHz,3.1mJy/beam@10km/s,246.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",353.60002904320197,825.6863664037603,"Bower, Geoffrey","ALMA detection and astrobiological potential of vinyl cyanide on Titan ALMACAL I: First Dual-band Number Counts from a Deep and Wide ALMA Submillimeter Survey, Free from Cosmic Variance Radio and Millimeter Monitoring of Sgr A*: Spectrum, Variability, and ","Bower, Geoffrey C.

Its spatial compactness (d<5pc) and extremely broad velocity width (dV>100 km/s) put the cloud in the category of high-velocity compact clouds (HVCCs). The association of an arc-shaped cavity which encloses a group of point-like IR sources may suggest that CO 0.02-0.02 has been accelerated by a series of supernova explosions in the embedded stellar cluster. However, we recently noticed that the highest-velocity gas in CO 0.02-0.02 significantly deviates from the cavity and its kinematics can not be reproduced by the single expanding-shell model. This means that plural different processes have contributed to its formation. Here we propose to observe the central region of CO 0.02-0.02 in the CO 3-2 line with ALMA. The primary objective of these observations is to examine kinematical models in the vicinity of the highest-velocity gas. We suppose the kinematics of multiple expanding shells, orbital motions around a compact mass, and outflows from protostars.

The association of an arc-shaped cavity which encloses a group of point-like IR sources may suggest that CO 0.02-0.02 has been accelerated by a series of supernova explosions in the embedded stellar cluster. However, we recently noticed that the highest-velocity gas in CO 0.02-0.02 significantly deviates from the cavity and its kinematics can not be reproduced by the single expanding-shell model. This means that plural different processes have contributed to its formation. Here we propose to observe the central region of CO 0.02-0.02 in the CO 3-2 line with ALMA. The primary objective of these observations is to examine kinematical models in the vicinity of the highest-velocity gas. We suppose the kinematics of multiple expanding shells, orbital motions around a compact mass, and outflows from protostars. Elucidating the origin of CO 0.02-0.02 contributes to the understanding of whole HVCCs and of the origin of turbulence in the central molecular zone.",CO_000.0_a_07_7M,"Oka, Tomoharu; Takekawa, Shunya; Tsujimoto, Shiho; Watanabe, Yuto;",27.777220535232996,0.997612578866109,0.9100000262260437,uid://A001/X1465/X1cd,uid://A001/X1465/X1d0,uid://A002/Xe4f0a6/X6d02,Resolving the Kinematics of the High-velocity Gas in CO 0.02-0.02,S,TARGET,T,20.605005671132453,1000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11 N605:CM04,T,2021-05-06T15:05:06.000,3.372434770655488,"[332.00..334.00GHz,1128.91kHz,29.1mJy/beam@10km/s,2.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [333.90..335.90GHz,1128.91kHz,24.9mJy/beam@10km/s,1.9mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [344.84..345.84GHz,1128.91kHz,24.8mJy/beam@10km/s,2.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [345.29..346.29GHz,1128.91kHz,25.3mJy/beam@10km/s,2.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [346.50..347.50GHz,1128.91kHz,27.6mJy/beam@10km/s,3mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [346.83..347.83GHz,1128.91kHz,27.8mJy/beam@10km/s,3mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",347.32968102316,975.7330268363522,"Iwata, Yuhei",,,T,,Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds,ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (8-7)

The high-mass star-forming clump G286.21+0.17 (G286 for short) that contains an 'L' type filament was thought to undergo global collapse. Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and astrochemistry. ...(9)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law).

The high-mass star-forming clump G286.21+0.17 (G286 for short) that contains an 'L' type filament was thought to undergo global collapse. Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and astrochemistry. ...(9)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions.

The high-mass star-forming clump G286.21+0.17 (G286 for short) that contains an 'L' type filament was thought to undergo global collapse. Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH.

We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores.

The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated.

The high-mass star-forming clump G286.21+0.17 (G286 for short) that contains an 'L' type filament was thought to undergo global collapse. Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms.

Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and astrochemistry. ...(9)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions.

Uncertainties in the distribution of Galactic center gas are a fundamental limitation to understanding the mass flows responsible for transporting gas from hundreds of parsecs to the scale of the black hole. We propose to make observations of CO absorption toward two dozen HII regions that will directly constrain the distribution of the dense and diffuse CMZ gas in the line of sight direction.

The high-mass star-forming clump G286.21+0.17 (G286 for short) that contains an 'L' type filament was thought to undergo global collapse. Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and astrochemistry. ...(9)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions. (3) investigate how globally collapse and stellar feedback influence CFE and the distributions of dense gas in proto-clusters.",I17439-2_a_03_TM1,"Bronfman, Leonardo; Yi, Hee-Weon; Juvela, Mika; Goldsmith, Paul; Garay, Guido; Wu, Yuefang; Qin, Sheng-Li; Tej, Anandmayee; Hirota, Tomoya; Kim, Kee-Tae; Yun, Hyeong-Sik; Zhang, Qizhou; Cunningham, Maria; Mardones, Diego; Kang, Sung-ju; Evans, Neal; Wu, Jingwen; Li, Pak Shing; Lee, Jeong-Eun; Wang, Ke; Toth, Laszlo Viktor; Ristorcelli, Isabelle; Liu, Sheng-Yuan; Tatematsu, Ken'ichi;",1.5236961628686523,0.041618931282352514,0.630641758441925,uid://A001/X1465/X288a,uid://A001/X1465/X288b,uid://A002/Xe2ada9/Xf64,On the origin of the dense gas star formation law in Galactic high-mass star forming clumps,S,TARGET,T,16.809762971313855,58593750.0,A001:DA48 A002:DA44 A005:DV22 A006:DV13 A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A024:DA58 A025:DV10 A027:DV17 A033:DA49 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A036:DA64 A040:DA65 A041:DV03 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA59 A072:DA53 A073:DV23 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A091:DA61 A094:DV14 T703:PM01,F,2021-03-31T01:53:23.000,1.310811327539718,"[86.31..86.36GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.72..86.78GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.81..86.87GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.27..87.33GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.60..88.66GHz,61.04kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [89.15..89.21GHz,61.04kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.53..99.40GHz,976.56kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,60uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.46..101.34GHz,976.56kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,63.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",86.8417506841007,205.1133080194908,"Liu, Tie",ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions - I.

The high-mass star-forming clump G286.21+0.17 (G286 for short) that contains an 'L' type filament was thought to undergo global collapse. Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and astrochemistry. ...(9)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions.

Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and astrochemistry. ...(9)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law).

The high-mass star-forming clump G286.21+0.17 (G286 for short) that contains an 'L' type filament was thought to undergo global collapse. Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated.

The high-mass star-forming clump G286.21+0.17 (G286 for short) that contains an 'L' type filament was thought to undergo global collapse. Our high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations resolve the gas kinematics of G286 and reveal two sub-clumps with very different velocities inside it. We find that the 'blue profile' (an indicator of gas infall) of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> lines in single dish observations of G286 is actually caused by gas emission from the two sub-clumps rather than gas infall. We advise great caution in interpreting gas kinematics (e.g. infall) from line profiles towards distant massive clumps in single dish observations. Energetic outflows are identified in G286 but the outflows are not strong enough to drive expansion of the two sub-clumps. The two parts of the 'L' type filament ('NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments) show prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes, indicating that they are likely formed due to large-scale compression flows. We argue that the large-scale compression flows could be induced by the expansion of nearby giant H II regions. The 'NW-SE' and 'NE-SW' filaments seem to be in collision, and a large amount of gas has been accumulated in the junction region where the most massive core G286c1 forms. Hot cores characterized by rich lines of complex organic molecules are considered as ideal sites for investigating the physical and chemical environments of massive star formation. We present a search for hot cores by using typical nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas temperatures (&gt; 100 K) and hot cores have small source sizes (&lt; 0.1 pc). So far, this is the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores. Column densities of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO increase as rotation temperatures rise. The column density of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO correlates tightly with that of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based on the spatial position difference between hot cores and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions, we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated, while the other hot cores are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and astrochemistry. ...(9)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions. (3) investigate how globally collapse and stellar feedback influence CFE and the distributions of dense gas in proto-clusters.",I17439-2_a_03_TM1,"Bronfman, Leonardo; Yi, Hee-Weon; Juvela, Mika; Goldsmith, Paul; Garay, Guido; Wu, Yuefang; Qin, Sheng-Li; Tej, Anandmayee; Hirota, Tomoya; Kim, Kee-Tae; Yun, Hyeong-Sik; Zhang, Qizhou; Cunningham, Maria; Mardones, Diego; Kang, Sung-ju; Evans, Neal; Wu, Jingwen; Li, Pak Shing; Lee, Jeong-Eun; Wang, Ke; Toth, Laszlo Viktor; Ristorcelli, Isabelle; Liu, Sheng-Yuan; Tatematsu, Ken'ichi;",1.5236963888129382,0.04161893101105735,0.630641758441925,uid://A001/X1465/X288a,uid://A001/X1465/X288b,uid://A002/Xe2ada9/Xf64,On the origin of the dense gas star formation law in Galactic high-mass star forming clumps,S,TARGET,T,16.79358021245167,58593750.0,A001:DA48 A002:DA44 A005:DV22 A006:DV13 A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A024:DA58 A025:DV10 A027:DV17 A033:DA49 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A036:DA64 A040:DA65 A041:DV03 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA59 A072:DA53 A073:DV23 A074:DV09 A075:DA56 A076:DA62 A082:DA60 A083:DA51 A085:DA52 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A091:DA61 A094:DV14 T703:PM01,F,2021-03-31T01:53:23.000,1.309273430413568,"[86.31..86.36GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.72..86.78GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [86.81..86.87GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [87.27..87.33GHz,122.07kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.8uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [88.60..88.66GHz,61.04kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [89.15..89.21GHz,61.04kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,338.9uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [97.53..99.40GHz,976.56kHz,1.4mJy/beam@10km/s,60uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.46..101.34GHz,976.56kHz,1.5mJy/beam@10km/s,63.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",86.8417240467032,205.1133080194908,"Liu, Tie",ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions - I.

M.","Using the JVLA, we explored the Galactic center (GC) with a resolution of 0.″05 at 33.0 and 44.6 GHz. We detected 64 hypercompact radio sources (HCRs) in the central parsec. The dense group of HCRs can be divided into three spectral types: 38 steep-spectrum (α ≤ -0.5) sources, 10 flat-spectrum (-0.5 &lt; α ≤ 0.2) sources, and 17 inverted-spectrum sources having α &gt; 0.2, assuming S ∝ ν <SUP> α </SUP>. The steep-spectrum HCRs are likely to represent a population of massive stellar remnants associated with nonthermal compact radio sources powered by neutron stars and stellar black holes. The surface-density distribution of the HCRs as a function of radial distance (R) from Sgr A* can be described as a steep power law Σ(R) ∝ R <SUP>-Γ</SUP>, with Γ = 1.6 ± 0.2, along with the presence of a localized order-of-magnitude enhancement in the range 0.1-0.3 pc. The steeper profile of the HCRs relative to that of the central cluster might result from the concentration of massive stellar remnants by mass segregation at the GC. The GC magnetar SGR J1745-2900 belongs to the inverted-spectrum subsample. We find two spectral components present in the averaged radio spectrum of SGR J1745-2900, separated at ν ~ 30 GHz. The centimeter component is fitted to a power law with α <SUB>cm</SUB> = -1.5 ± 0.6. The enhanced millimeter component shows a rising spectrum α <SUB>mm</SUB> = 1.1 ± 0.2. Based on the ALMA observations at 225 GHz, we find that the GC magnetar is highly variable on a day-to-day timescale, showing variations up to a factor of 6. Further JVLA and ALMA observations of the variability, spectrum, and polarization of the HCRs are critical for determining whether they are associated with stellar remnants.",2022,"Sagittarius A*, the variable radio/IR/X-ray source associated with the supermassive black hole at the center of the Galaxy, has recently (April-May 2019) displayed unusual episodes of activity in the infrared and at 230 GHz. An unprecedentedly bright intensity excursion was observed at 2.2 µm with the Keck Observatory, well outside of the range of the 13,000 previous independent integrations with Keck, VLT and Spitzer. Other Keck observations in April and May have also shown episodes of unusually high fluxes, leading us to consider whether the source has entered a new, higher state of activity, or whether its accretion rate has risen. In either case, it is important to learn whether it is evolving and how long it will last, presuming that it is lasting longer than the April-May time frame.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars.

These new observations reveal the presence of a ring-like molecular structure surrounding the star. Morphology and kinematics of the gas are consistent with a slowly expanding torus located near the equatorial plane of AG Car. Using non-LTE line modelling, we derived the physical parameters of the gas, which is warm (∼50 K) and moderately dense (∼10<SUP>3</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). The total mass of molecular gas in the ring is 2.7 ± 0.9 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. We analysed the radio continuum map, which depicts a point-like source surrounded by a shallow nebula. From the flux of the point-like source, we derived a current mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = (1.55\pm 0.21)\times 10^{-5}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Finally, to better understand the complex circumstellar environment of AG Car, we put the newly detected ring in relation to the main nebula of dust and ionized gas. We discuss possible formation scenarios for the ring, namely, the accumulation of interstellar material due to the action of the stellar wind, the remnant of a close binary interaction or merger, and an equatorially enhanced mass-loss episode. If molecular gas formed in situ as a result of a mass eruption, it would account for at least a $30{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the total mass ejected by AG Car. This detection adds a new piece to the puzzle of the complex mass-loss history of AG Car, providing new clues about the interplay between LBV stars and their surroundings.",2021,"Massive stars play a fundamental role in the evolution of galaxies. they are among the major contributors to the interstellar UV radiation and provide processed material and mechanical energy to the ISM via their strong winds.Evolutionary models fail to reproduce the transition between their O and WR phases, mostly because of the poor knowledge of the amount of mass lost during the transition. recent work on three LBVs has shown that a so far neglected component of molecular gas is present around these stars. On the basis, of the three previous detections and our APEX data, we propose to observe 9 Galactic LBVs with the ACA in the 12CO and 13CO J=2-1 lines. The immediate goal of our project is to detect the CO emission and estimate the associated nebular mass as well as a first kinematic analysis of the molecular gas.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars. We propose to map the ISM in 12'x12' regions around eight of these hot spots with the ACA in a number of molecular lines.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars. We propose to map the ISM in 12'x12' regions around eight of these hot spots with the ACA in a number of molecular lines. These data will trace the localized impact of feedback through measuring shocks, PDRs, elevated excitation, and through a detailed dynamical analysis.",Position_p_03_7M,"Ott, Juergen; Mills, Elisabeth; Krieger, Nico; Meier, David; Ginsburg, Adam;",93.28776369513446,1.9249566111184535,5.185999870300293,uid://A001/X1465/X102b,uid://A001/X1465/X102c,uid://A002/Xe45e29/Xdb0f,Localized Feedback Processes in the Galactic CMZ,S,TARGET,T,72.27218602220437,2000000000.0,J501:CM10 J502:CM02 J503:CM03 J504:CM12 J505:CM08 J506:CM05 N601:CM07 N602:CM01 N603:CM09 N604:CM11,T,2021-03-23T17:26:34.000,12.232932738196046,"[92.90..94.90GHz,1128.91kHz,93.3mJy/beam@10km/s,3.7mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [94.70..96.70GHz,1128.91kHz,91.2mJy/beam@10km/s,3.6mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [105.35..107.35GHz,1128.91kHz,94mJy/beam@10km/s,4mJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [106.85..108.85GHz,1128.91kHz,98.4mJy/beam@10km/s,4.2mJy/beam@native, XX YY]",93.90001156689866,3167.4466780927555,"Candelaria, Tierra",,,T,,"Outflows, jets, feedback, Galactic centres/nuclei",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,N2H+ (1-0)

R.","We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array observations of the candidate jet-ISM interaction zones near the black hole X-ray binaries GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942. Using these data, we map the molecular line emission in the regions, detecting emission from the HCN [J = 1-0], HCO<SUP>+</SUP> [J = 1-0], SiO [J = 2-1], CS [J = 2-1], <SUP>13</SUP>CO [J = 1-0], C<SUP>18</SUP>O [J = 1-0], HNCO [J = 4<SUB>0,4</SUB>-3<SUB>0,3</SUB>], HNCO [J = 5<SUB>0,5</SUB>-4<SUB>0,4</SUB>], and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH [J = 2<SUB>1,1</SUB>-1<SUB>1,0</SUB>] molecular transitions. Through examining the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of this emission, we identify molecular structures that may trace jet-driven cavities in the gas surrounding these systems. Our results from the GRS 1758-258 region in particular, are consistent with recent work, which postulated the presence of a jet-blown cocoon structure in deep radio continuum maps of the region. Using these newly discovered molecular structures as calorimeters, we estimate the time averaged jet power from these systems, finding $(1.1{\!-\!}5.7)\times 10^{36}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.12-0.31 Myr for GRS 1758-258 and $(0.7{\!-\!}3.5)\times 10^{37}{\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$ over 0.10-0.26 Myr for 1E 1740.7-2942. Additionally, the spectral line characteristics of the detected emission place these molecular structures in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy, thereby constraining the distances to the black hole X-ray binaries to be 8.0 ± 1.0 kpc. Overall, our analysis solidifies the diagnostic capacity of molecular lines, and highlights how astro-chemistry can both identify jet-ISM interaction zones and probe jet feedback from Galactic X-ray binaries.",2020,"Relativistic jets launched from accreting black holes carry large amounts of energy and matter into their environment. Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), the stellar-mass analogues of active galactic nuclei, are ideal targets for studying the interactions between the jet and the ambient ISM in detail, due to their close proximity and the rapid timescale evolution of BHXB jets. Identifying and probing the ISM properties in interaction zones provides insight into highly sought-after jet properties, such as the jet power, composition, duty cycles, and the efficiency of jet feedback. As molecular lines are excellent diagnostics of shock energetics and ISM excitation, our team recently obtained ALMA ACA observations of the candidate interaction sites around the BHXBs GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942, identifying several intriguing compact regions of bright molecular emission. Here we propose follow-up, high resolution ALMA 12m array observations of these fields (total time of 2.3 hours).

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars. We propose to map the ISM in 12'x12' regions around eight of these hot spots with the ACA in a number of molecular lines.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes.

These abundant molecular lines may tell us a great deal about protostellar cores, outflows, shocks, and general gas properties, but at the moment, we do not know which lines are associated with different physical processes. A reference survey showing which lines are excited and where they are excited is needed to interpret existing CMZ observations, to plan future observations, and to enable comparison between our CMZ and the centers of other galaxies. We propose a blind, complete spectral line survey covering bands 3-7 of a single pointing in the CMZ to determine which lines can be used to trace: (1) protostellar cores, (2) turbulent shocks, (3) diffuse and quiescent molecular gas, and (4) protostellar outflows in the CMZ. We will run this program as a legacy survey, releasing data immediately, and we will produce data products that will inform ongoing and future CMZ programs.",BrickMas_d_03_TM1,"Longmore, Steven; Barnes, Ashley; Walker, Daniel; Kauffmann, Jens; Mills, Elisabeth; Bally, John; Henshaw, Jonathan; Kruijssen, Diederik; Battersby, Cara; Meier, David; Ott, Juergen; Sanchez-Monge, Alvaro; Immer, Katharina; Contreras, Yanett; Rosolowsky, Erik;",0.5793943729501784,0.012425603071050145,2.909785032272339,uid://A001/X1465/X3a5e,uid://A001/X1465/X3a5f,uid://A002/Xe7b231/X84b5,What lines trace which processes in the CMZ?,S,TARGET,T,14.052585882107882,1875000000.0,A001:DA48 A002:DA44 A007:DV21 A010:DV15 A011:DV07 A015:DV25 A016:DV24 A022:DV01 A023:DV12 A024:DA58 A025:DV10 A033:DA49 A034:DV08 A035:DA43 A036:DA64 A040:DA65 A043:DA42 A044:DA55 A045:DA57 A047:DV06 A048:DA50 A049:DA63 A050:DV19 A058:DA41 A062:DV02 A068:DV20 A069:DA45 A070:DA62 A072:DA53 A073:DA51 A075:DV18 A076:DA56 A082:DA52 A083:DA59 A085:DA60 A086:DV22 A087:DV03 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A093:DV04 A094:DV14,F,2021-06-16T15:37:33.000,1.0416803636262586,"[97.55..99.42GHz,1128.91kHz,575.3uJy/beam@10km/s,24.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [99.42..101.30GHz,1128.91kHz,570.2uJy/beam@10km/s,24.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [109.55..111.42GHz,1128.91kHz,579.4uJy/beam@10km/s,25.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [111.42..113.30GHz,1128.91kHz,574.8uJy/beam@10km/s,25.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",110.48526361636337,3037.00748902648,"Ginsburg, Adam",,,T,,"Astrochemistry, Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM)/Molecular clouds",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,"13CO (1-0), C18O (1-0)"

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars.

As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region G358.93-0.03. Since then, the global maser community has discovered 20 new torsionally-excited methanol maser transitions from 6 to 360 GHz toward this source(!), all likely powered by an ongoing accretion outburst in a massive protostar. SMA and ALMA DDT observations have pinpointed the deeply-embedded outbursting object, which powers a line-rich hot core and lacks a near-IR counterpart, much like NGC6334I-MM1. Measuring the lifetime of the excited masers and the rate of decline of the heated dust continuum is now critical to compare to the first two cases, which we will achieve by repeating the 400 au resolution DDT observations in Band 5 and 7. We also propose new Band 6 and 7 observations designed to disentangle the multiple outflows present in the host protocluster, and assess the energetics, and hence dynamical impact of massive protostellar episodic accretion.",G358.93_b_07_TM1,"Hirano, Naomi; MacLeod, Gordon; Chen, Xi; Chibueze, James; Menten, Karl; Sobolev, Andrey; Cyganowski, Claudia; Sugiyama, Koichiro; McGuire, Brett; Hunter, Todd; Stecklum, Bringfried; Burns, Ross;",0.36846460301015055,0.013526355524669765,0.4701294004917145,uid://A001/X1465/X2492,uid://A001/X1465/X2493,uid://A002/Xec0d12/Xcacb,Tracking the lifetime and resolving the properties of the massive protostellar accretion outburst in G358.93-0.03,S,TARGET,T,2.530806664608724,1875000000.0,A007:DV21 A008:DA46 A011:DV07 A015:DV25 A022:DV01 A024:DA58 A027:DV17 A033:DA49 A035:DA43 A040:DA65 A042:DV05 A043:DA42 A045:DA57 A047:DV06 A060:DA47 A062:DV02 A066:DA54 A068:DV20 A070:DA62 A072:DA53 A073:DA51 A074:DV09 A075:DV18 A076:DA56 A083:DA59 A085:DA60 A086:DV22 A087:DV03 A088:DV11 A089:DV16 A090:DV13 A091:DA61 A092:DV23 A093:DV04 A094:DV14 A096:DA44 A104:DA45 A105:DV15 A108:DA50 A110:DA48 A111:DV19 A115:DA64 A116:PM04 A120:DV12 A121:PM01 A122:DA55 A123:DA63 A128:DV24 A134:PM03 A135:DV10,F,2022-05-28T16:25:31.000,0.11493651020980854,"[290.52..292.40GHz,976.56kHz,375uJy/beam@10km/s,27uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [292.46..294.33GHz,976.56kHz,374.2uJy/beam@10km/s,27uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [302.50..304.37GHz,976.56kHz,368.5uJy/beam@10km/s,27.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [304.19..306.06GHz,976.56kHz,367.9uJy/beam@10km/s,27.1uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",303.436543539248,962.374192330862,"Brogan, Crystal",,,T,,"Outflows, jets and ionized winds, High-mass star formation",ISM and star formation,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (7-6)

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars.

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars. We propose to map the ISM in 12'x12' regions around eight of these hot spots with the ACA in a number of molecular lines. These data will trace the localized impact of feedback through measuring shocks, PDRs, elevated excitation, and through a detailed dynamical analysis.",Position_l_06_TP,"Ott, Juergen; Mills, Elisabeth; Krieger, Nico; Meier, David; Ginsburg, Adam;",9.011130257099902,0.3010931148316523,0.6067453622817993,uid://A001/X1465/X1073,uid://A001/X1465/X1076,uid://A002/Xeae3c6/X600d,Localized Feedback Processes in the Galactic CMZ,S,TARGET,T,366.57660551485947,2000000000.0,A134:PM03 T703:PM01 T704:PM04,F,2022-04-23T20:38:34.000,20.680759824400262,"[244.31..246.31GHz,1128.91kHz,9.2mJy/beam@10km/s,585.4uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [245.50..247.50GHz,1128.91kHz,8.8mJy/beam@10km/s,565.6uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [260.14..262.14GHz,1128.91kHz,9mJy/beam@10km/s,594.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY] U [262.00..264.00GHz,1128.91kHz,10.3mJy/beam@10km/s,680.7uJy/beam@native, XX YY]",261.1405164074133,1291.5796727173083,"Candelaria, Tierra",,,T,,"Outflows, jets, feedback, Galactic centres/nuclei",Active galaxies,2022-07-07T22:43:17.085,,SiO (6-5)

Many sources contribute to feedback, including stars, black holes, and supernovae. They release energetic photons, and inject mechanical energy, momentum, metals, and cosmic rays into their surrounding ISM. This dramatically influences the star formation efficiencies. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy hosts some environments with dramatic feedback, like the star forming region Sgr B2 and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. In addition, there are many less studied regions where the ISM is clearly energized by some process and the combination of those small scale regions may substantially contribute to the overall CMZ feedback processes. From our unique CMZ molecular gas temperature maps, we select eight regions with substantially increased temperature. These regions show a mix of elevated turbulence, SNe and WR stars.
